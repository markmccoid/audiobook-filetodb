A perfect one free of suffering and drama? Or one filled with surprise and delight?” From the 1950s to the 1970s, Eastern spiritual philosophies sparked in the West profound new ways of perceiving ourselves, the mysteries of reality, and the unfolding destiny of humanity. And through his live gatherings and radio talks, Alan Watts was at the forefront—igniting astonishing insights into who we are and where we're heading. Based on a legendary series of seminars, Just So illuminates three fascinating domains: money versus real wealth, the spirituality of a deeper materialism, and how technology and spirituality are both guiding us to ever greater interconnection in the universe that we find ourselves in. Along the way, readers will explore many other themes, at turns humorous, prescient, and more relevant today than ever. What unfolds is a liberating view of humanity that arises from possibility and the unpredictable—perfect and “just so,” not in spite of its messy imperfections, but because of them.

Are you constantly searching for something you can’t put your finger on, or wondering whether you are living a life that truly fits? In Archetypes: Who Are You?, New York Times best-selling author Caroline Myss delves into the world of archetypes, which have been the subject of her work for more than 25 years. Archetypes are universal patterns of behavior that, once discovered, help you better understand yourself and your place in the world. In short, knowing your archetypes can transform your life. Within the pages of this book, Myss writes about ten primary feminine archetypes that have emerged in today’s society: the Caregiver, the Artist/Creative, the Fashionista, the Intellectual, the Rebel, the Queen/Executive, the Advocate, the Visionary, the Athlete, and the Spiritual Seeker. In each chapter, she explains one individual archetype, showing how it has evolved and then in fascinating detail lays out the unique characteristics, the defining graces, the life challenges, and other information to help you understand if you are part of this archetype family and if so, how you can fully tap into its power. She also offers tips and practical advice on how to fully engage with your archetypes. Learning which archetypes best describe you is just the beginning. You can then use this knowledge to make more conscious decisions about everything from careers to relationships, avoiding common pitfalls of your personality type while playing up your strengths. The result is a happier, more authentic you. It’s never too late to change your life by embracing your archetypes to the fullest. So are you a Rebel? An Artist? A Visionary?

Based on fifteen years of research into energy medicine, Dr. Myss's work shows how every illness corresponds to a pattern of emotional and psychological stresses, beliefs, and attitudes that have influenced corresponding areas of the human body. Anatomy of the Spirit also presents Dr. Myss's breakthrough model of the body's seven centers of spiritual and physical power, in which she synthesizes the ancient wisdom of three spiritual traditions-the Hindu chakras, the Christian sacraments, and the Kabbalah's Tree of Life-to demonstrate the seven stages through which everyone must pass in the search for higher consciousness and spiritual maturity. With this model, Dr. Myss shows how you can develop your own latent powers of intuition as you simultaneously cultivate your personal power and spiritual growth.

Myss’s experience of working with people led her to develop an insightful and ingenious process for deciphering your own Sacred Contract—or higher purpose—using a new theory of archetypes that builds on the works of Jung, Plato, and many other contemporary thinkers. Myss examines the lives of the spiritual masters and prophets—Abraham, Jesus, Buddha, and Muhammad—whose archetypal journeys illustrate the four stages of a Sacred Contract and provide clues for discovering your own. Myss explains how you can identify your particular spiritual energies, or archetypes—the gatekeepers of your higher purpose—and use them to help you find out what you are here on earth to learn and whom you are meant to meet. Exploring your Sacred Contract will shine a light on the purpose and meaning of your life. You are meant to do certain tasks, you are meant to have certain relationships. In coming to know your archetypal companions, you also begin to see how to live your life in ways that make the best use of your personal power and lead you to fulfill your greatest—in fact, your divine—potential. Both visionary and practical, Sacred Contracts is a bold, powerful work of spiritual wisdom. Without a doubt, your most intriguing challenge in life is to recognize your spiritual commitments and live them to the fullest.","author":"Caroline Myss","authors":["Caroline Myss"],"narratedBy":"Caroline Myss","publishedYear":2002,"releaseDate":"2003-01-28","publisher":"Harmony","pageCount":466,"bookLength":"5:59:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XR9_AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","categories":["Relationships, Parenting & Personal Development - Personal Development - Personal Success","Body, Mind & Spirit"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Productivity"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Switch","description":"Why is it so hard to make lasting changes in our companies, in our communities, and in our own lives? The primary obstacle is a conflict that's built into our brains, say Chip and Dan Heath, authors of the critically acclaimed bestseller Made to Stick. Psychologists have discovered that our minds are ruled by two different systems - the rational mind and the emotional mind—that compete for control. The rational mind wants a great beach body; the emotional mind wants that Oreo cookie. The rational mind wants to change something at work; the emotional mind loves the comfort of the existing routine. This tension can doom a change effort - but if it is overcome, change can come quickly. In Switch, the Heaths show how everyday people - employees and managers, parents and nurses - have united both minds and, as a result, achieved dramatic results: • The lowly medical interns who managed to defeat an entrenched, decades-old medical practice that was endangering patients • The home-organizing guru who developed a simple technique for overcoming the dread of housekeeping • The manager who transformed a lackadaisical customer-support team into service zealots by removing a standard tool of customer service In a compelling, story-driven narrative, the Heaths bring together decades of counterintuitive research in psychology, sociology, and other fields to shed new light on how we can effect transformative change. Switch shows that successful changes follow a pattern, a pattern you can use to make the changes that matter to you, whether your interest is in changing the world or changing your waistline.","author":"Dan Heath","authors":["Chip Heath","Dan Heath"],"narratedBy":"Charles Kahlenberg","publishedYear":2010,"releaseDate":"2010-02-16","publisher":"National Geographic Books","bookLength":"7:43:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4UCNEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","categories":["Relationships, Parenting & Personal Development - Personal Development - Personal Success","Business & Economics"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Productivity"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"A History of Rome","author":"Cyril Robinson","authors":["Cyril Edward Robinson"],"narratedBy":"Charlton Griffin","publishedYear":2002,"releaseDate":"1946","pageCount":540,"bookLength":"18:42:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SLlOAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","categories":["History - Military","Rome"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Education"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Finding Your Passion","description":"Beloved author and teacher Cheryl Richardson updates her classic, New York Times best-selling self-care manual, giving you the permission and practical tools you need to dramatically upgrade your life. \"For the last 20 years I've dedicated my personal and professional life to the importance of self-care by teaching from my own experience,\" writes Cheryl Richardson. \"In the past, I've sacrificed my health and my relationships for work, given to others at the expense of my own needs, and watched my dreams slip through the cracks of a busy life.

On November 22, 1963, three shots rang out in Dallas, President Kennedy died, and the world changed. What if you could change it back? In this brilliantly conceived tour de force, Stephen King—who has absorbed the social, political, and popular culture of his generation more imaginatively and thoroughly than any other writer—takes readers on an incredible journey into the past and the possibility of altering it. It begins with Jake Epping, a thirty-five-year-old English teacher in Lisbon Falls, Maine, who makes extra money teaching GED classes. He asks his students to write about an event that changed their lives, and one essay blows him away—a gruesome, harrowing story about the night more than fifty years ago when Harry Dunning’s father came home and killed his mother, his sister, and his brother with a sledgehammer. Reading the essay is a watershed moment for Jake, his life—like Harry’s, like America’s in 1963—turning on a dime. Not much later his friend Al, who owns the local diner, divulges a secret: his storeroom is a portal to the past, a particular day in 1958. And Al enlists Jake to take over the mission that has become his obsession—to prevent the Kennedy assassination. So begins Jake’s new life as George Amberson, in a different world of Ike and JFK and Elvis, of big American cars and sock hops and cigarette smoke everywhere. From the dank little city of Derry, Maine (where there’s Dunning business to conduct), to the warmhearted small town of Jodie, Texas, where Jake falls dangerously in love, every turn is leading eventually, of course, to a troubled loner named Lee Harvey Oswald and to Dallas, where the past becomes heart-stoppingly suspenseful, and where history might not be history anymore. Time-travel has never been so believable. Or so terrifying.","author":"Stephen King","authors":["Stephen King"],"narratedBy":"Craig Wasson","publishedYear":2011,"releaseDate":"2011-11-08","publisher":"Scribner","bookLength":"30:40:00","imageURL":"","categories":["Science Fiction & Fantasy - Science Fiction - Alternate History","Fiction"],"pathPrimaryCat":"Fiction","pathSecondaryCat":"General Fiction"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"God's Debris","author":"Scott Raymond Adams","narratedBy":"D.

A story of youth and promise, of loss and the search for love, of secrets and destiny, Blackwood Farm is Anne Rice at her mesmerizing best.","author":"Anne Rice","authors":["Anne Rice"],"narratedBy":"David Pittu","publishedYear":2002,"releaseDate":"2003-09-30","publisher":"Ballantine Books","pageCount":638,"bookLength":"20:37:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hu6LOTlYxi8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","categories":["Literature & Fiction - Horror - Ghosts","Fiction"],"pathPrimaryCat":"Fiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Horror"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Blood Canticle","description":"Anne Rice continues her astonishing Vampire Chronicles in a new novel that begins where Blackwood Farm left off — and tells the story of Lestat’s quest for redemption, goodness, and the love of Rowan Mayfair. Welcome back to Blackwood Farm. Here are all of the brilliantly conceived characters that make up the two worlds of vampires and witches: Mona Mayfair, who’s come to the farm to die and is brought into the realm of the undead; her uncle, Julian Mayfair, guardian of the family, determined to forever torment Lestat for what he has done to Mona; Rowan Mayfair, brilliant neurosurgeon and witch, who finds herself dangerously drawn to the all-powerful Lestat; her husband, Michael Curry, hero of the Mayfair Chronicles, who seeks Lestat’s help with the temporary madness of his wife; Ash Templeton, a 5,000-year-old Taltos who has taken Mona’s child; and Patsy, the country-western singer, who returns to avenge her death at the hands of her son, Quinn Blackwood. Delightfully, at the book’s centre is the Vampire Lestat, once the epitome of evil, now pursuing the transformation set in motion with Memnoch the Devil. He struggles with his vampirism and yearns for goodness, purity and love, as he saves Patsy’s ghost from the dark realm of the Earthbound, uncovers the mystery of the Taltos and unselfishly decides the fate of his beloved Rowan Mayfair.

His recent move to Paris has inspired hilarious pieces, including Me Talk Pretty One Day, about his attempts to learn French. His family is another inspiration. You Cant Kill the Rooster is a portrait of his brother who talks incessant hip-hop slang to his bewildered father. And no one hones a finer fury in response to such modern annoyances as restaurant meals presented in ludicrous towers and cashiers with 6-inch fingernails.

Now Dr. Chopra, hailed by Time as “the poet-prophet of alternative medicine,” returns to this groundbreaking exploration of consciousness and the power of mindfulness, adding the latest scientific research as well as expanded thoughts on the connection between body and mind. Inspired by the unexplained recovery of patients in his own practice who had been given just a few months to live, Dr. Chopra began his search for answers. After returning to his native India to explore humanity’s most ancient healing tradition, Ayurveda, he combined those insights with Western medicine, neuroscience, and physics. What he discovered—a “network of intelligence” in the human body with the potential to defeat cancer, heart disease, even aging itself—forms the basis of Quantum Healing. In this new edition, Dr. Chopra once again offers a fascinating intellectual journey and a deeply moving chronicle of hope and healing. Praise for Quantum Healing “Quantum Healing didn’t set out to cure cancer or Alzheimer’s or any other intractable disease. It set out to see the human body, and human existence in general, through wiser eyes. As a scientist I’m passionate about genes and the brain; as a person I’m totally fascinated by the origins of consciousness. Quantum Healing galvanized my intuition that these areas do not have to be separated.”—Dr. Rudolph Tanzi, from the new foreword “Deepak Chopra illuminates our true innate capacity for healing, growth, and evolution. With the wisdom of an experienced doctor, girded by science, he guides us to reclaim our natural power towards thriving. Chopra’s work is paradigm-changing for medicine and helpful beyond measure for every human being seeking to evolve, flourish, and know our true nature.”—Lisa Miller, Ph.D., author of The Spiritual Child and director of clinical psychology, Teachers College, Columbia University","author":"Deepak Chopra","authors":["Deepak Chopra, M.D."],"narratedBy":"Deepak Chopra","publishedYear":2002,"releaseDate":"2015-11-17","publisher":"Bantam","pageCount":369,"bookLength":"1:58:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OjXZCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","categories":["Body, Mind & Spirit"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"General Fiction"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Reinventing the Body Resurrecting the Soul","description":"Deepak Chopra presents ten lessons to help build awareness and change the distorted energy patterns that are the root cause of aging, infirmity, and disease. Fifteen years after his #1 New York Times bestseller, Ageless Body, Timeless Mind, Deepak Chopra revisits \"the forgotten miracle\"–the body's infinite capacity for change and renewal. You cannot take advantage of this miracle, Chopra says, unless you are willing to completely reinvent your body, transforming it from a material object to a dynamic, flowing process. \"Your physical body is a fiction,\" Chopra contends. Every cell is made up of two invisible ingredients: awareness and energy. Transformation can't stop with the body, however; it must involve the soul. The soul–seemingly invisible, aloof, and apart from the material world–actually creates the body. Only by going to the level of the soul will you access your full potential, bringing more intelligence, creativity, and awareness into every aspect of your life. Reinventing the Body, Resurrecting the Soul delivers ten breakthroughs–five for the body, five for the soul–that lead to self-transformation. In clear, accessible terms, Chopra shows us how to commit ourselves to deeper awareness, focus on relationships instead of consumption, embrace every day as a new world, and transcend the obstacles that afflict body and mind. Deepak Chopra has inspired millions with his profound teachings over the years. His bestselling books have explored the mind/body connection and the power of spirit. With his latest book, he invites you to experience with him the miracles that unfold when we connect the body directly to the awesome mysteries that give life meaning–directly to the soul. When you have completed this journey, after reinventing your body and resurrecting your soul, the ecstasy of true wholeness becomes possible for the very first time.","author":"Deepak Chopra","authors":["Deepak Chopra, M.D."],"narratedBy":"Deepak Chopra MD","publishedYear":2009,"releaseDate":"2010-10-05","publisher":"Harmony","pageCount":306,"bookLength":"10:14:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6yVY1gR8ubIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","categories":["Relationships, Parenting & Personal Development - Personal Development - Personal Success","Body, Mind & Spirit"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Productivity"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"The Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire","description":"As elegant as his bestselling How to Know God and as practical as his phenomenal The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success, this groundbreaking new book from Deepak Chopra contains a dramatic premise: Not only are everyday coincidences meaningful, they actually provide us with glimpses of the field of infinite possibilities that lies at the heart of all things. By gaining access to this wellspring of creation, we can literally rewrite our destinies in any way we wish. From this realm of pure potential we are connected to everything that exists and everything that is yet to come. “Coincidences” can then be recognized as containing precious clues about particular facets of our lives that require our attention. As you become more aware of coincidences and their meanings, you begin to connect more and more with the underlying field of infinite possibilities. This is when the magic begins. This is when you achieve the spontaneous fulfillment of desire. At a time when world events may leave us feeling especially insignificant and vulnerable, Deepak Chopra restores our awareness of the awesome powers within us.

For centuries, electricity was seen as little more than a curious property of certain substances that sparked when rubbed. Then, in the 1790s, Alessandro Volta began the scientific investigation that ignited an explosion of knowledge and invention. The force that once seemed inconsequential was revealed to be responsible for everything from the structure of the atom to the functioning of our brains. In harnessing its power, we have created a world of wonders—complete with roller coasters and radar, computer networks and psychopharmaceuticals. In Electric Universe, the great discoverers come to life in all their brilliance and idiosyncrasy, including the visionary Michael Faraday, who struggled against the prejudices of the British class system, and Samuel Morse, a painter who, before inventing the telegraph, ran for mayor of New York City on a platform of persecuting Catholics. Here too is Alan Turing, whose dream of a marvelous thinking machine—what we know as the computer—was met with indifference, and who ended his life in despair after British authorities forced him to undergo experimental treatments to “cure” his homosexuality. From the frigid waters of the Atlantic to the streets of Hamburg during a World War II firestorm to the interior of the human body, Electric Universe is a mesmerizing journey of discovery.","author":"David Bodanis","authors":["David Bodanis"],"narratedBy":"Del Roy","publishedYear":2005,"releaseDate":"2006-02-28","publisher":"Crown","pageCount":322,"bookLength":"6:38:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-gPoU_NVoGIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","categories":["Science & Engineering - Science - Physics","Science"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Science"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"The Marriage of Sense and Soul","description":"There is arguably no more critical and pressing topic than the relation of science and religion in the modern world. Science has given us the methods for discovering truth, while religion remains the single greatest force for generating meaning. Yet the two are seen as mutually exclusive, with wrenching consequences for humanity. In The Marriage of Sense and Soul, one of today's most important philosophers brilliantly articulates how we might begin to think about science and religion in ways that allow for their reconciliation and union, on terms that will be acceptable to both camps. Ken Wilber is widely acclaimed as the foremost thinker in integrating Western psychology and the Eastern spiritual traditions. His many books have reached across disciplines and synthesized the teachings of religion, psychology, physics, mysticism, sociology, and anthropology, earning him a devoted international following. The Marriage of Sense and Soul is his most accessible work yet, aimed at guiding a general audience to the mutual accord between the spiritual, subjective world of ancient wisdom and the objective, empirical world of modern knowledge. Wilber clearly and succinctly explores the schism between science and religion, and the impact of this \"philosophical Cold War\" on the fate of humanity. He systematically reviews previous attempts at integration, explaining why romantic, idealistic, and postmodern theories failed. And he demonstrates how science is compatible with certain deep features common to all of the world's major religious traditions. In pointing the way to a union between truth and meaning, Ken Wilber has created an elegant and accessible book that is breathtaking in its scope.","author":"Ken Wilber","authors":["Ken Wilber"],"narratedBy":"Denis deBoisblanc","publishedYear":2000,"releaseDate":"2011-08-03","publisher":"Random House","pageCount":224,"bookLength":"7:21:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uQGmVyPN6rUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","categories":["Science & Engineering - Science - History & Philosophy - History","Science"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Education"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Willpower","description":"One of the world's most esteemed and influential psychologists, Roy F.

The practice of meditation takes us on a fabulous journey into the gap between our thoughts, where all the advantages of a more peaceful, stress-free, healthy, and fatigue-free life are available—but they’re merely side benefits. The paramount reason for daily meditation is to get into the gap between our thoughts and make conscious contact with the creative energy of life itself. In this uplifting book, Dr. Wayne W. Dyer explains the soul-nourishing meditation technique for making conscious contact with God, which the ancient masters have told us about. You have all the potential to be an instrument of the highest good for all concerned and to be a literal miracle worker in your own life. No person, government entity, or religious group can legitimately claim to do this for you. \"In fact,\" says Dr. Dyer, \"I agree with Carl Jung, who said that one of the main functions of formalized religion is to protect people against a direct experience of God.\" (Dr. Dyer helps you have this direct experience by leading you through the meditation technique in the accompanying audio download.)

Dyer has reviewed hundreds of translations of the Tao Te Ching and has written 81 distinct essays on how to apply the ancient wisdom of Lao-tzu to today s modern world. This work contains the entire 81 verses of the Tao, compiled from Wayne s researching of 10 of the most well-respected translations of text that have survived for more than 25 centuries. Each chapter is designed for actually living the Tao or the Great Way today. Some of the chapter titles are Living with Flexibility, Living Without Enemies, and Living by Letting Go. Each of the 81 brief chapters focuses on living the Tao and concludes with a section called Doing the Tao Now. Wayne spent one entire year reading, researching, and meditating on Lao-tzu s messages, practicing them each day and ultimately writing down these essays as he felt Lao-tzu wanted you to know them.This is a work to be read slowly, one essay a day. As Wayne says, This is a book that will forever change the way you look at your life, and the result will be that you ll live in a new world aligned with nature.

Deepak Chopra says that higher consciousness is available here and now. “Metahuman helps us harvest peak experiences so we can see our truth and mold the universe’s chaos into a form that brings light to the world.”—Dr. Mehmet Oz, attending physician, New York–Presbyterian, Columbia University New York Times bestselling author Deepak Chopra unlocks the secrets to moving beyond our present limitations to access a field of infinite possibilities. How does one do this? By becoming metahuman. To be metahuman, however, isn’t science fiction and is certainly not about being a superhero. To be metahuman means to move past the limitation constructed by the mind and enter a new state of awareness where we have deliberate and concrete access to peak experiences that can transform people’s lives from the inside out. Humans do this naturally—to a point. For centuries the great artists, scientists, writers, and many so-called ordinary people have gone beyond the everyday physical world. But if we could channel these often bewildering experiences, what would happen? Chopra argues we would wake up to experiences that would blow open your body, mind, and soul. Metahuman invites the reader to walk the path here and now. Waking up, we learn, isn’t just about mindfulness or meditation. Waking up, to become metahuman, is to expand our consciousness in all that we think, say, and do. By going beyond, we liberate ourselves from old conditioning and all the mental constructs that underlie anxiety, tension, and ego-driven demands. Waking up allows life to make sense as never before. To make this as practical as possible, Chopra ends the book with a 31-day guide to becoming metahuman. Once you wake up, he writes, life becomes transformed, because pure consciousness—which is the field of all possibilities—dawns in your life. Only then does your infinite potential become your personal reality.","author":"Deepak Chopra MD","authors":["Deepak Chopra, M.D."],"narratedBy":"Dr. Wayne W.

Recent pioneering experiments in neuroplasticity–the ability of the brain to change in response to experience–reveal that the brain is capable of altering its structure and function, and even of generating new neurons, a power we retain well into old age. The brain can adapt, heal, renew itself after trauma, compensate for disabilities, rewire itself to overcome dyslexia, and break cycles of depression and OCD. And as scientists are learning from studies performed on Buddhist monks, it is not only the outside world that can change the brain, so can the mind and, in particular, focused attention through the classic Buddhist practice of mindfulness. With her gift for making science accessible, meaningful, and compelling, Sharon Begley illuminates a profound shift in our understanding of how the brain and the mind interact and takes us to the leading edge of a revolution in what it means to be human. “There are two great things about this book. One is that it shows us how nothing about our brains is set in stone. The other is that it is written by Sharon Begley, one of the best science writers around.

If we had to vanish tomorrow, what would we want as our legacy? When Randy Pausch, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon, was asked to give such a lecture, he didn't have to imagine it as his last, since he had recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer.

But to reach his goal, Jack must make his way not only across the breadth of the United States but also through the wondrous and menacing parallel world of the Territories. In the Territories, Jack finds another realm, where the air is so sweet and clear a man can smell a radish being pulled from the ground a mile away—and a life can be snuffed out instantly in the continuing struggle between good and evil. Here Jack discovers “Twinners,” reflections of the people he knows on earth—most notably Queen Laura, the Twinner of Jack’s own imperiled mother.

Twenty years ago, a boy named Jack Sawyer traveled to a parallel universe called the Territories to save his mother and her Territories “Twinner” from an agonizing death that would have brought cataclysm to the other world. Now Jack is a retired Los Angeles homicide detective living in the nearly nonexistent hamlet of Tamarack, Wisconsin. He has no recollection of his adventures in the Territories, and was compelled to leave the police force when an odd, happenstance event threatened to awaken those memories. When a series of gruesome murders occur in western Wisconsin that are reminiscent of those committed several decades ago by a madman named Albert Fish, the killer is dubbed “the Fishman,” and Jack’s buddy, the local chief of police, begs Jack to help the inexperienced force find him. But are these new killings merely the work of a disturbed individual, or has a mysterious and malignant force been unleashed in this quiet town? What causes Jack’s inexplicable waking dreams—if that is what they are—of robins’ eggs and red feathers? It’s almost as if someone is trying to tell him something. As this cryptic message becomes increasingly impossible to ignore, Jack is drawn back to the Territories and to his own hidden past, where he may find the soul-strength to enter a terrifying house at the end of a deserted tract of forest, there to encounter the obscene and ferocious evils sheltered within it.","author":"Stephen King","authors":["Stephen King","Peter Straub"],"narratedBy":"Frank Muller","publishedYear":2001,"releaseDate":"2018-04-17","publisher":"Gallery Books","pageCount":672,"bookLength":"26:27:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jEsKygEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","categories":["Literature & Fiction - Horror - Ghosts","Fiction"],"pathPrimaryCat":"Fiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Horror"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Dr. Quantum Presents A User's Guide to Your Universe","description":"Exploring the definitions of soul provided by Plato, Aristotle, St. Thomas Aquinas, and Buddhism, an award-winning author relates them to quantum physics where the soul must be understood as a process rather than an entity contrasted to matter. 20,000 first printing.","author":"Fred Alan Wolf","authors":["Fred Alan Wolf"],"narratedBy":"Fred Alan Wolf","publishedYear":2006,"releaseDate":"1996","publisher":"Pocket Books","pageCount":376,"bookLength":"7:29:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EEDXAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","categories":["Science & Engineering - Science - Physics","Philosophy"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Science"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Dr. Quantum Presents Meet the Real Creator - You!","description":"Wolf--aka Dr. Quantum--is a physicist who knows how to put complex science-based ideas into terms that even science-phobes can understand.

The decisions that reached his desk impacted people around the world and defined the times in which we live. Decision Points brings readers inside the Texas governor’s mansion on the night of the 2000 election, aboard Air Force One during the harrowing hours after the attacks of September 11, 2001, into the Situation Room moments before the start of the war in Iraq, and behind the scenes at the White House for many other historic presidential decisions. For the first time, we learn President Bush’s perspective and insights on: • His decision to quit drinking and the journey that led him to his Christian faith • The selection of the vice president, secretary of defense, secretary of state, Supreme Court justices, and other key officials • His relationships with his wife, daughters, and parents, including heartfelt letters between the president and his father on the eve of the Iraq War • His administration’s counterterrorism programs, including the CIA’s enhanced interrogations and the Terrorist Surveillance Program • Why the worst moment of the presidency was hearing accusations that race played a role in the federal government’s response to Hurricane Katrina, and a critical assessment of what he would have done differently during the crisis • His deep concern that Iraq could turn into a defeat costlier than Vietnam, and how he decided to defy public opinion by ordering the troop surge • His legislative achievements, including tax cuts and reforming education and Medicare, as well as his setbacks, including Social Security and immigration reform • The relationships he forged with other world leaders, including an honest assessment of those he did and didn’t trust • Why the failure to bring Osama bin Laden to justice ranks as his biggest disappointment and why his success in denying the terrorists their fondest wish—attacking America again—is among his proudest achievements A groundbreaking new brand of presidential memoir, Decision Points will captivate supporters, surprise critics, and change perspectives on eight remarkable years in American history—and on the man at the center of events.","author":"George W.

New revelations in physics and biology suggest that we’re about to find out! A growing body of scientific evidence suggests that our universe works like a Consciousness Computer. Rather than the number codes of typical software, our Consciousness Computer uses a language that we all have, yet are only beginning to understand. Life’s reality code is based in the language of human emotion and focused belief. Knowing that belief is our reality-maker, the way we think of ourselves and our world is now more important than ever! For us to change the beliefs that have led to war, disease, and the failed careers and relationships of our past we need a reason to see things differently. Our ancestors used miracles to change what they believed. Today we use science. The Spontaneous Healing of Belief offers us both: the miracles that open the door to a powerful new way of seeing the world, and the science that tells us why the miracles are possible, revealing: why we are not limited by the \"laws\" of physics and biology as we know them today. Once we become aware of the paradigm-shattering discoveries and true-life miracles, we must think of ourselves differently. And that difference is where the spontaneous healing of belief begins.","author":"Gregg Braden","authors":["Gregg Braden"],"narratedBy":"Gregg Braden","publishedYear":2008,"releaseDate":"2009-04-01","publisher":"Hay House, Inc","pageCount":241,"bookLength":"4:36:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=c1z6DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","categories":["Relationships, Parenting & Personal Development - Personal Development - Personal Success","Body, Mind & Spirit"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Productivity"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Awakening the Power of a Modern God","description":"Braden explores the miracles that open the door to a powerful new way of seeing the world, and the science that tells why miracles are possible.","author":"Gregg Braden","authors":["Gregg Braden"],"narratedBy":"Gregg Braden","publishedYear":2006,"releaseDate":"2009-12","publisher":"ReadHowYouWant.com","pageCount":394,"bookLength":"3:35:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UzoVQEfJ1c4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","categories":["Religion & Spirituality - Spirituality","Self-Help"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Spirituality"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Beyond Zero Point","description":"Seventeen hundred years ago, key elements of our ancient heritage were lost, relegated to the esoteric traditions of mystery schools and sacred orders. Among the most empowering of the forgotten elements are references to a science with the power to bring everlasting healing to our bodies and initiate an unprecedented era of peace and cooperation between governments and nations. In his groundbreaking new book, The Isaiah Effect, Gregg Braden turns to the Isaiah Scroll, perhaps the most important of the Dead Sea Scrolls discovered in 1946, to offer insight into a powerful form of ancient prayer. In The Isaiah Effect, Braden, author of Awakening to Zero Point and Walking Between the Worlds, combines research in quantum physics with the works of the prophet Isaiah and the ancient Essenes. He demonstrates how prophecies of global catastrophe and suffering may only represent future possibilities, rather than forecast impending doom, and that we have the power to influence those possibilities. In addition to describing multiple futures, the Isaiah texts take us one step further, clearly describing the science of how we choose our futures. Tracing key words of Isaiah's text back to their original language, we discover how he taught a mode of prayer that was lost to the West during Biblical editing in the fourth century. Braden offers detailed accounts of how elements of this mode of prayer have been applied in a variety of situations, ranging from healing life-threatening conditions to entire villages using collective prayer to prevail during the 1998 fires in southern Peru. In each instance, the correlation between the offering of the prayer and a shift of the events in question was beyond coincidence--the prayers had measurable effects! As modern science continues to validate a relationship between our outer and inner worlds, it becomes more likely that a forgotten bridge links the world of our prayers with that of our experience. Each time we engage ourselves, our loved ones, and our communities with Isaiah's life-affirming message of hope, we secure nothing less than our future and the future of the only home we know.","author":"Gregg Braden","authors":["Gregg Braden"],"narratedBy":"Gregg Braden","publishedYear":1999,"releaseDate":"2009-02-04","publisher":"Harmony","pageCount":304,"bookLength":"2:32:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=858MnPizsnkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","categories":["Religion & Spirituality - Occult - Unexplained Mysteries","Body, Mind & Spirit"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Education"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"The Illusion of Limitation","description":"Open your eyes to the wise and gentle presence of a bright new power that already lives within you... enter its timeless kingdom where fear, doubt, and despair cannot tread.

The lines between 'science' and 'science fiction' have become increasingly blurred. Now, quantum mechanics promises that some of humanity's wildest dreams may be realized. Serious scientists, working from Einstein's theories, have been investigating the phenomenon known as 'entanglement' one of the strangest aspects of our strange universe. According to Einstein, quantum mechanics required entanglement, the idea that subatomic particles could become linked and that a change to one such particle would instantly be reflected in its counterpart, even if separated by a universe. Einstein felt that if quantum theory could produce such bizarre effects, then it had to be invalid. But new experiments show not only that it does happen, but that it may lead to unbreakable codes and even teleportation, perhaps in our lifetimes. This is a highly accessible yet technically well researched introduction to the bizarre phenomenon of entanglement and the scientists who have helped to discover it. The book provides an excellent introduction to a complex but exciting branch of science that could have significant implications for our understanding of the world and the way we live. * Amir D. Aczel is an internationally known author and speaker who attracts large crowds * We have all seen teleportation in science fiction. This book shows how it could become a reality. * The first book to explain the theory of entanglement and to make recent developments in quantum mechanics widely available. * Gives an insight into the lives and thinking of some of the leading physicists of the past century.","author":"Amir D.

Who understood the risk inherent in the assumption of ever-rising real estate prices, a risk compounded daily by the creation of those arcane, artificial securities loosely based on piles of doubtful mortgages? In this fitting sequel to Liar’s Poker, Michael Lewis answers that question in a narrative brimming with indignation and dark humor.","author":"Michael Lewis","authors":["Michael Lewis"],"narratedBy":"Jesse Boggs","publishedYear":2010,"releaseDate":"2015-11-16","publisher":"W.

Is it possible to change your brain? Norman Doidge’s inspiring guide to the new brain science explains all of this and more An astonishing new science called neuroplasticity is overthrowing the centuries-old notion that the human brain is immutable, and proving that it is, in fact, possible to change your brain. Psychoanalyst, Norman Doidge, M.D., traveled the country to meet both the brilliant scientists championing neuroplasticity, its healing powers, and the people whose lives they’ve transformed—people whose mental limitations, brain damage or brain trauma were seen as unalterable. We see a woman born with half a brain that rewired itself to work as a whole, blind people who learn to see, learning disorders cured, IQs raised, aging brains rejuvenated, stroke patients learning to speak, children with cerebral palsy learning to move with more grace, depression and anxiety disorders successfully treated, and lifelong character traits changed. Using these marvelous stories to probe mysteries of the body, emotion, love, sex, culture, and education, Dr. Doidge has written an immensely moving, inspiring book that will permanently alter the way we look at our brains, human nature, and human potential.","author":"Norman Doidge M.D.","authors":["Norman Doidge"],"narratedBy":"Jim Bond","publishedYear":2008,"releaseDate":"2007-12-18","publisher":"National Geographic Books","bookLength":"11:24:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KaaMEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","categories":["Health & Wellness - Physical Illness & Disease","Psychology"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Health Wellness"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Rich Dad's Prophecy","description":"Explains how baby boomers can look forward to a profitable retirement by presenting a detailed financial plan to help prepare for the worst and avert a long-term financial crisis.

The Psychopath Test is the New York Times bestselling exploration of their world and the madness industry. When Jon Ronson is drawn into an elaborate hoax played on some of the world's top scientists, his investigation leads him, unexpectedly, to psychopaths. He meets an influential psychologist who is convinced that many important business leaders and politicians are in fact high-flying, high-functioning psychopaths, and teaches Ronson how to spot them. Armed with these new abilities, Ronson meets a patient inside an asylum for the criminally insane who insists that he's sane, a mere run-of-the-mill troubled youth, not a psychopath—a claim that might be only manipulation, and a sign of his psychopathy. He spends time with a death-squad leader institutionalized for mortgage fraud, and with a legendary CEO who took joy in shutting down factories and firing people. He delves into the fascinating history of psychopathy diagnosis and treatments, from LSD-fueled days-long naked therapy sessions in prisons to attempts to understand serial killers. Along the way, Ronson discovers that relatively ordinary people are, more and more, defined by their most insane edges.

Clearly, he must be doing something right since each one has been something new and different. What they do have in common is imaginative originality, great stories, and unique scientific extrapolation. His latest is no exception. Hominids is a strong, stand-alone SF novel, but it's also the first book of The Neanderthal Parallax, a trilogy that will examine two unique species of people. They are alien to each other, yet bound together by the never-ending quest for knowledge and, beneath their differences, a common humanity. We are one of those species, the other is the Neanderthals of a parallel world where they, not Homo sapiens, became the dominant intelligence. In that world, Neanderthal civilization has reached heights of culture and science comparable to our own, but is very different in history, society, and philosophy. During a risky experiment deep in a mine in Canada, Ponter Boddit, a Neanderthal physicist, accidentally pierces the barrier between worlds and is transferred to our universe, where in the same mine another experiment is taking place. Hurt, but alive, he is almost immediately recognized as a Neanderthal, but only much later as a scientist. He is captured and studied, alone and bewildered, a stranger in a strange land. But Ponter is also befriended-by a doctor and a physicist who share his questing intelligence and boundless enthusiasm for the world's strangeness, and especially by geneticist Mary Vaughan, a lonely woman with whom he develops a special rapport. Meanwhile, Ponter's partner, Adikor Huld, finds himself with a messy lab, a missing body, suspicious people all around, and an explosive murder trial that he can't possibly win because he has no idea what actually happened. Talk about a scientific challenge! Contact between humans and Neanderthals creates a relationship fraught with conflict, philosophical challenge, and threat to the existence of one species or the other-or both-but equally rich in boundless possibilities for cooperation and growth on many levels, from the practical to the esthetic to the scientific to the spiritual. In short, Robert J. Sawyner has done it again. Hominids is the winner of the 2003 Hugo Award for Best Novel.

Armand, who first appeared in all his dark glory more than twenty years ago in the now-classic Interview with the Vampire, the first of The Vampire Chronicles, the novel that established its author worldwide as a magnificent storyteller and creator of magical realms.

And in a magnificent palazzo in the Venice of the Renaissance we see him emotionally and intellectually in thrall to the great vampire Marius, who masquerades among humankind as a mysterious, reclusive painter and who will bestow upon Armand the gift of vampiric blood. As the novel races to its climax, moving through scenes of luxury and elegance, of ambush, fire, and devil worship to nineteenth-century Paris and today's New Orleans, we see its eternally vulnerable and romantic hero forced to choose between his twilight immortality and the salvation of his immortal soul.","author":"Anne Rice","authors":["Anne Rice"],"narratedBy":"Jonathan Marosz","publishedYear":2000,"releaseDate":"2000-10-03","publisher":"Ballantine Books","pageCount":401,"bookLength":"15:46:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cOKFeoU49KIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","categories":["Fiction"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"General Fiction"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Keep Going","description":"Grandfather says this: “In life there is sadness as well as joy, losing as well as winning, falling as well as standing, hunger as well as plenty, bad as well as good.

Fifteen years of peace and prosperity under the rule of Lord Otori Takeo and his wife Kaede is threatened by a rogue network of assassins, the resurgence of old rivalries, the arrival of foreigners bearing new weapons and religion, and an unfulfilled prophecy that Lord Takeo will die at the hand of a member of his own family.

How have the three dominant monotheistic religions—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam—shaped and altered the conception of God? How have these religions influenced each other? In this stunningly intelligent book, Karen Armstrong, one of Britain's foremost commentators on religious affairs, traces the history of how men and women have perceived and experienced God, from the time of Abraham to the present. The epic story begins with the Jews' gradual transformation of pagan idol worship in Babylon into true monotheism—a concept previously unknown in the world. Christianity and Islam both rose on the foundation of this revolutionary idea, but these religions refashioned 'the One God' to suit the social and political needs of their followers. From classical philosophy and medieval mysticism to the Reformation, Karen Armstrong performs the near miracle of distilling the intellectual history of monotheism into one superbly readable volume, destined to take its place as a classic. Praise for History of God “An admirable and impressive work of synthesis that will give insight and satisfaction to thousands of lay readers.”—The Washington Post Book World “A brilliantly lucid, spendidly readable book. [Karen] Armstrong has a dazzling ability: she can take a long and complex subject and reduce it to the fundamentals, without oversimplifying.”—The Sunday Times (London) “Absorbing . . . A lode of learning.”—Time “The most fascinating and learned study of the biggest wild goose chase in history—the quest for God. Karen Armstrong is a genius.”—A.N.

David persuades her to tell the story of her life. Pandora begins, reluctantly at first and then with increasing passion, to recount her mesmerizing tale, which takes us through the ages, from Imperial Rome to eighteenth-century France to twentieth-century Paris and New Orleans. She carries us back to her mortal girlhood in the world of Caesar Augustus, a world chronicled by Ovid and Petronius. This is where Pandora meets and falls in love with the handsome, charismatic, lighthearted, still-mortal Marius. This is the Rome she is forced to flee in fear of assassination by conspirators plotting to take over the city. And we follow her to the exotic port of Antioch, where she is destined to be reunited with Marius, now immortal and haunted by his vampire nature, who will bestow on her the Dark Gift as they set out on the fraught and fantastic adventure of their two turbulent centuries together.

He pioneered the first mindfulness-based treatment program for people suffering from OCD, teaching patients how to achieve long-term relief from their compulsions. Schwartz works with psychiatrist Rebecca Gladding to refine a program that successfully explains how the brain works and why we often feel besieged by overactive brain circuits (i.e. bad habits, social anxieties, etc.) the key to making life changes that you want—to make your brain work for you—is to consciously choose to “starve” these circuits of focused attention, thereby decreasing their influence and strength. You Are Not Your Brain carefully outlines their program, showing readers how to identify negative impulses, channel them through the power of focused attention, and ultimately lead more fulfilling and empowered lives.","author":"Jeffrey M.

In Questions and Answers on Conversations with God, Neale, with characteristic wit and wisdom, responds to the most compelling and provocative of these letters; and the result is a book that is profoundly enlightening and inspiring. By relating the messages in the dialogues of CWG to the personal issues and everyday experience of individuals, Neale's answers illustrate the direct link between spiritual and physical reality, clearly demonstrating how what we do and who we are in our lives is a result of how we think and what we believe.

In the Conversations books, Walsch shared with his readers the beginning of a sacred relationship, as he began an exchange with God on everything from love and faith, to life and death, and good and evil. And then, as Walsch recounted in Friendship with God, something else extraordinary began to happen. His relationship with God began to strengthen and deepen, just as our own relationships do, into a friendship. Now in Communion with God, his most richly intimate book yet, Walsch discovers how to elevate that friendship to a state of communion. In this blueprint for seekers, he reveals The Ten Illusions of Man-the misconceptions we hold about ourselves and our world and our God. He describes with striking clarity how we might heal the great divide that has arisen from these illusions. And as he explores the true meaning of bringing God into our everyday lives, of having the courage of our convictions. Walsch shows us that we can only break free from our illusions when we act always from a place of deep fellowship with all that is holy-a place of communion with God.","author":"Neale Donald Walsch","authors":["Neale Donald Walsch"],"narratedBy":"Neale Donald Walsch ","publishedYear":2000,"releaseDate":"2002-10-01","publisher":"Penguin","pageCount":240,"bookLength":"5:57:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=u5YdfwbR-fMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","categories":["Religion & Spirituality - Christianity - Bibles & Bible Study - Bible Study","Religion"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Spirituality"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"The Colour of Magic","description":"Twoflower was a tourist, the first ever seen on the Discworld.

The interaction between the generally reasonable, rational, ethical, moral conscious mind and the repressed feelings of emotional pain, hurt, sadness, and anger characteristic of the unconscious mind appears to be the basis for mindbody disorders. The Divided Mind traces the history of psychosomatic medicine, including Freud's crucial role, and describes the psychology responsible for the broad range of psychosomatic illness. The failure of medicine's practitioners to recognize and appropriately treat mindbody disorders has produced public health and economic problems of major proportions in the United States. One of the most important aspects of psychosomatic phenomena is that knowledge and awareness of the process clearly have healing powers. Thousands of people have become pain-free simply by reading Dr. Sarno's previous books. How and why this happens is a fascinating story, and is revealed in The Divided Mind.","author":"John E.

Working with our mind is the only means through which we’ll actually begin to feel happy and contented with the world that we live in.” —Pema Chödrön Pema Chödrön is treasured around the world for her unique ability to transmit teachings and practices that bring peace, understanding, and compassion into our lives. With How to Meditate, the American-born Tibetan Buddhist nun presents her first book exploring in depth what she considers the essentials for a lifelong practice. More and more people are beginning to recognize a profound inner longing for authenticity, connection, and aliveness. Meditation, Pema explains, gives us a golden key to address this yearning. This step-by-step guide shows readers how to honestly meet and openly relate with the mind, embrace the fullness of our experience, and live in a wholehearted way as we discover: - The basics of meditation, from getting settled and the six points of posture to working with your breath and cultivating an attitude of unconditional friendliness - The Seven Delights—how moments of difficulty can become doorways to awakening and love - Shamatha (or calm abiding), the art of stabilizing the mind to remain present with whatever arises - Thoughts and emotions as “sheer delight”—instead of obstacles—in meditation “I think ultimately why we practice is so that we can become completely loving people, and this is what the world needs,” writes Pema Chödrön.

In The Head Trip, science journalist Jeff Warren explores twelve distinct, natural states of consciousness available to us in a twenty-four-hour day, each state offering its own kind of knowledge and insight – its own adventure. The hypnagogic state, when our minds hover between waking and sleeping, can be a rich source of creativity and even compassion. Then there’s the Watch, an almost magical waking experience in the middle of the night that has been all but lost to electric light and modern sleep patterns. Daydreaming and trance, lucid dreaming, the Zone, and the Pure Conscious Event – from sleep laboratory to remote northern cabin, neurofeedback clinic to Buddhist retreat, Warren visits them all. Along the way, he talks to neuroscientists, chronobiologists, anthropologists, monks, and many others who illuminate his stories with cutting-edge science and age-old wisdom. On this trip, all are welcome and no drugs are required: all you need to pack are a functioning cerebrum and an open mind. Replete with stylish graphics and brightened by comic panels conceived and drawn by the author, The Head Trip is an instant classic, a brilliant and original description of the shifting experience of consciousness that’s also a practical guide to enhancing creativity and mental health.

It is, above all, a way of asserting power.”—The New Yorker In 1984, London is a grim city in the totalitarian state of Oceania where Big Brother is always watching you and the Thought Police can practically read your mind. Winston Smith is a man in grave danger for the simple reason that his memory still functions. Drawn into a forbidden love affair, Winston finds the courage to join a secret revolutionary organization called The Brotherhood, dedicated to the destruction of the Party. Together with his beloved Julia, he hazards his life in a deadly match against the powers that be. Lionel Trilling said of Orwell’s masterpiece, “1984 is a profound, terrifying, and wholly fascinating book. It is a fantasy of the political future, and like any such fantasy, serves its author as a magnifying device for an examination of the present.” Though the year 1984 now exists in the past, Orwell’s novel remains an urgent call for the individual willing to speak truth to power.","author":"George Orwell","authors":["George Orwell"],"narratedBy":"Richard Brown","publishedYear":1999,"releaseDate":"2013-09-03","publisher":"HarperCollins","pageCount":304,"bookLength":"11:28:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kotPYEqx7kMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","categories":["Teen & Young Adult - Arts & Entertainment","Fiction"],"pathPrimaryCat":"Fiction","pathSecondaryCat":"General Fiction"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Days of Magic Nights of War","description":"Clive Barker, author of The Thief of Always, delivers an epic battle filled with fantasy and adventure that readers won't want to put down!

In Misquoting Jesus, Ehrman tells the story behind the mistakes and changes that ancient scribes made to the New Testament and shows the great impact they had upon the Bible we use today. He frames his account with personal reflections on how his study of the Greek manuscripts made him abandon his once ultraconservative views of the Bible. Since the advent of the printing press and the accurate reproduction of texts, most people have assumed that when they read the New Testament they are reading an exact copy of Jesus's words or Saint Paul's writings. And yet, for almost fifteen hundred years these manuscripts were hand copied by scribes who were deeply influenced by the cultural, theological, and political disputes of their day. Both mistakes and intentional changes abound in the surviving manuscripts, making the original words difficult to reconstruct. For the first time, Ehrman reveals where and why these changes were made and how scholars go about reconstructing the original words of the New Testament as closely as possible. Ehrman makes the provocative case that many of our cherished biblical stories and widely held beliefs concerning the divinity of Jesus, the Trinity, and the divine origins of the Bible itself stem from both intentional and accidental alterations by scribes -- alterations that dramatically affected all subsequent versions of the Bible.","author":"Bart D.

The golden-haired Marius, true Child of the Millennia, once mentor to The Vampire Lestat, always and forever the conscientious foe of the Evil Doer, reveals in his own intense yet inti- mate voice the secrets of his two-thousand-year existence. Once a proud Senator in Imperial Rome, kidnapped and made a “blood god” by the Druids, Marius becomes the embittered protector of Akasha and Enkil, Queen and King of the vampires, in whom the core of the supernatural race resides. We follow him through his heartbreaking abandonment of the vampire Pandora. Through him we see the fall of pagan Rome to the Emperor Constantine and the horrific sack of the Eternal City itself at the hands of the Visigoths. Bravely, Marius seeks a new civilization in the midst of glittering Constantinople, only to meet with the blood drinker Eudoxia. We see him ultimately returning to his beloved Italy, where after the horrors of the Black Death, he is restored by the beauty of the Renaissance. We see him become a painter living dangerously yet happily among mortals, giving his heart to the great Botticelli, to the bewitching courtesan Bianca, and to the mysterious young apprentice Armand. Moving from Rome to Florence, Venice, and Dresden, and to the English castle of the secret scholarly order of the Talamasca, the novel reaches its dramatic finale in our own time, deep in the jungle where Marius, having told his life story, seeks some measure of justice from the oldest vampires in the world.","author":"Anne Rice","authors":["Anne Rice"],"narratedBy":"Roger Rees","publishedYear":2001,"releaseDate":"2001-10-16","publisher":"Knopf","pageCount":480,"bookLength":"18:36:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KHqJDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","categories":["Literature & Fiction - Horror - Ghosts","Fiction"],"pathPrimaryCat":"Fiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Horror"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"A Dance with Dragons","description":"In the aftermath of a colossal battle, new threats are emerging from every direction.

R. Martin’s monumental epic cycle of high fantasy that began with A Game of Thrones. Now, in A Feast for Crows, Martin delivers the long-awaited fourth book of his landmark series, as a kingdom torn asunder finds itself at last on the brink of peace . . . only to be launched on an even more terrifying course of destruction. A Feast for Crows It seems too good to be true. After centuries of bitter strife and fatal treachery, the seven powers dividing the land have decimated one another into an uneasy truce. Or so it appears. . . . With the death of the monstrous King Joffrey, Cersei is ruling as regent in King’s Landing. Robb Stark’s demise has broken the back of the Northern rebels, and his siblings are scattered throughout the kingdom like seeds on barren soil. Few legitimate claims to the once desperately sought Iron Throne still exist—or they are held in hands too weak or too distant to wield them effectively. The war, which raged out of control for so long, has burned itself out. But as in the aftermath of any climactic struggle, it is not long before the survivors, outlaws, renegades, and carrion eaters start to gather, picking over the bones of the dead and fighting for the spoils of the soon-to-be dead. Now in the Seven Kingdoms, as the human crows assemble over a banquet of ashes, daring new plots and dangerous new alliances are formed, while surprising faces—some familiar, others only just appearing—are seen emerging from an ominous twilight of past struggles and chaos to take up the challenges ahead. It is a time when the wise and the ambitious, the deceitful and the strong will acquire the skills, the power, and the magic to survive the stark and terrible times that lie before them. It is a time for nobles and commoners, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and sages to come together and stake their fortunes . . . and their lives. For at a feast for crows, many are the guests—but only a few are the survivors.","author":"George R.R. Martin","authors":["George R. R.

A STORM OF SWORDS Of the five contenders for power, one is dead, another in disfavor, and still the wars rage as violently as ever, as alliances are made and broken. Joffrey, of House Lannister, sits on the Iron Throne, the uneasy ruler of the land of the Seven Kingdoms. His most bitter rival, Lord Stannis, stands defeated and disgraced, the victim of the jealous sorceress who holds him in her evil thrall. But young Robb, of House Stark, still rules the North from the fortress of Riverrun.

A GAME OF THRONES Long ago, in a time forgotten, a preternatural event threw the seasons out of balance. In a land where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister and supernatural forces are massing beyond the kingdom's protective Wall. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the land they were born to. Sweeping from a land of brutal cold to a distant summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty, here is a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards, who come together in a time of grim omens. Here an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal; a tribe of fierce wildlings carry men off into madness; a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to win back his throne; and a determined woman undertakes the most treacherous of journeys. Amid plots and counterplots, tragedy and betrayal, victory and terror, the fate of the Starks, their allies, and their enemies hangs perilously in the balance, as each endeavors to win that deadliest of conflicts: the game of thrones. \"From the Paperback edition.\"","author":"George R.R.

One night in October when he was ten years old, Tyler Dupree stood in his back yard and watched the stars go out. They all flared into brilliance at once, then disappeared, replaced by a flat, empty black barrier. He and his best friends, Jason and Diane Lawton, had seen what became known as the Big Blackout. It would shape their lives. The effect is worldwide. The sun is now a featureless disk--a heat source, rather than an astronomical object. The moon is gone, but tides remain. Not only have the world's artificial satellites fallen out of orbit, their recovered remains are pitted and aged, as though they'd been in space far longer than their known lifespans. As Tyler, Jason, and Diane grow up, space probe reveals a bizarre truth: The barrier is artificial, generated by huge alien artifacts. Time is passing faster outside the barrier than inside--more than a hundred million years per day on Earth. At this rate, the death throes of the sun are only about forty years in our future. Jason, now a promising young scientist, devotes his life to working against this slow-moving apocalypse. Diane throws herself into hedonism, marrying a sinister cult leader who's forged a new religion out of the fears of the masses. Earth sends terraforming machines to Mars to let the onrush of time do its work, turning the planet green. Next they send humans...and immediately get back an emissary with thousands of years of stories to tell about the settling of Mars. Then Earth's probes reveal that an identical barrier has appeared around Mars. Jason, desperate, seeds near space with self-replicating machines that will scatter copies of themselves outward from the sun--and report back on what they find.

Legendary business writer Seth Godin has three essential questions for every marketer: “What’s your story?” “Will the people who need to hear this story believe it?” “Is it true?” All marketers tell stories. And if they do it right, we believe them. We believe that wine tastes better in a $20 glass than a $1 glass. We believe that an $80,000 Porsche is vastly superior to a $36,000 Volkswagen that’s virtually the same car. We believe that $225 sneakers make our feet feel better—and look cooler—than a $25 brand. And believing it makes it true. As Seth Godin has taught hundreds of thousands of marketers and students around the world, great marketers don’t talk about features or even benefits. Instead, they tell a story—a story we want to believe, whether it’s factual or not. In a world where most people have an infinite number of choices and no time to make them, every organization is a marketer, and all marketing is about telling stories. Marketers succeed when they tell us a story that fits our worldview, a story that we intuitively embrace and then share with our friends. Think of the Dyson vacuum cleaner, or Fiji water, or the iPod. But beware: If your stories are inauthentic, you cross the line from fib to fraud. Marketers fail when they are selfish and scurrilous, when they abuse the tools of their trade and make the world worse. That’s a lesson learned the hard way by telemarketers, cigarette companies, and sleazy politicians. But for the rest of us, it’s time to embrace the power of the story. As Godin writes, “Stories make it easier to understand the world. Stories are the only way we know to spread an idea. Marketers didn’t invent storytelling. They just perfected it.”","author":"Seth Godin","authors":["Seth Godin"],"narratedBy":"Seth Godin","publishedYear":2005,"releaseDate":"2012-04-24","publisher":"Penguin","pageCount":241,"bookLength":"4:17:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3LFPEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","categories":["Business & Careers - Marketing & Sales - Marketing","Business & Economics"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Business Wealth"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"The Science of Enlightenment","description":"Enlightenment—is it a myth or is it real?

The sort of person the prisoner became was the result of an inner decision and not of camp influences alone. Only those who allowed their inner hold on their moral and spiritual selves to subside eventually fell victim to the camp's degenerating influence - while those who made a victory of those experiences turned them into an inner triumph.

Now he stands ready to revolutionize both neuroscience and computing in one stroke, with a new understanding of intelligence itself. Hawkins develops a powerful theory of how the human brain works, explaining why computers are not intelligent and how, based on this new theory, we can finally build intelligent machines. The brain is not a computer, but a memory system that stores experiences in a way that reflects the true structure of the world, remembering sequences of events and their nested relationships and making predictions based on those memories. It is this memory-prediction system that forms the basis of intelligence, perception, creativity, and even consciousness. In an engaging style that will captivate audiences from the merely curious to the professional scientist, Hawkins shows how a clear understanding of how the brain works will make it possible for us to build intelligent machines, in silicon, that will exceed our human ability in surprising ways. Written with acclaimed science writer Sandra Blakeslee, On Intelligence promises to completely transfigure the possibilities of the technology age. It is a landmark book in its scope and clarity.","author":"Jeff Hawkins","authors":["Jeff Hawkins","Sandra Blakeslee"],"narratedBy":"Stefan Rudnicki ","publishedYear":2005,"releaseDate":"2007-04-01","publisher":"Macmillan","pageCount":272,"bookLength":"9:22:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Qg2dmntfxmQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","categories":["Health & Wellness - Psychology & Mental Health - Psychology","Computers"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Health Wellness"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Ender's Game","description":"\"The classic of modern science fiction\"--Front cover.","author":"Orson Scott Card","authors":["Orson Scott Card"],"narratedBy":"Stefan Rudnicki ","publishedYear":2001,"releaseDate":"2017-10-17","publisher":"Tor Books","pageCount":448,"bookLength":"11:57:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jaM7DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","categories":["Science Fiction & Fantasy - Science Fiction - Adventure","Fiction"],"pathPrimaryCat":"Fiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Action Suspense"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"The Wee Free Men","description":"EVERY LAND NEEDS ITS OWN WITCH.

Moscow-born Sergey Brin and Midwest-born Larry Page dropped out of graduate school at Stanford University to, as they said, “change the world” through a powerful search engine that would organize every bit of information on the Web for free. The Google Story takes you deep inside the company’s wild ride from an idea that struggled for funding in 1998 to a firm that today rakes in billions in profits. Based on scrupulous research and extraordinary access to Google, this fast-moving narrative reveals how an unorthodox management style and a culture of innovation enabled a search-engine giant to shake up Madison Avenue, clash with governments that accuse it of being a monopoly, deploy self-driving cars to forever change how we travel, and launch high-flying Internet balloons. Unafraid of controversy, Google is surging ahead with artificial intelligence that could cure diseases but also displace millions of people from their jobs, testing the founders’ guiding mantra: DON’T BE EVIL.

In the mid-seventies, Steve Martin exploded onto the comedy scene. By 1978 he was the biggest concert draw in the history of stand-up. In 1981 he quit forever. This book is, in his own words, the story of “why I did stand-up and why I walked away.” Emmy and Grammy Award–winner, author of the acclaimed New York Times bestsellers Shopgirl and The Pleasure of My Company, and a regular contributor to The New Yorker, Martin has always been a writer. His memoir of his years in stand-up is candid, spectacularly amusing, and beautifully written. At age ten Martin started his career at Disneyland, selling guidebooks in the newly opened theme park. In the decade that followed, he worked in the Disney magic shop and the Bird Cage Theatre at Knott’s Berry Farm, performing his first magic/comedy act a dozen times a week. The story of these years, during which he practiced and honed his craft, is moving and revelatory. The dedication to excellence and innovation is formed at an astonishingly early age and never wavers or wanes. Martin illuminates the sacrifice, discipline, and originality that made him an icon and informs his work to this day. To be this good, to perform so frequently, was isolating and lonely. It took Martin decades to reconnect with his parents and sister, and he tells that story with great tenderness. Martin also paints a portrait of his times—the era of free love and protests against the war in Vietnam, the heady irreverence of The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour in the late sixties, and the transformative new voice of Saturday Night Live in the seventies. Throughout the text, Martin has placed photographs, many never seen before. Born Standing Up is a superb testament to the sheer tenacity, focus, and daring of one of the greatest and most iconoclastic comedians of all time.","author":"Steve Martin","authors":["Steve Martin"],"narratedBy":"Steve Martin","publishedYear":2007,"releaseDate":"2007-11-20","publisher":"Simon and Schuster","pageCount":227,"bookLength":"4:02:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NqBNe1RIDHsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","categories":["Biographies & Memoirs - Entertainment & Celebrities","Biography & Autobiography"],"pathPrimaryCat":"Biographies","pathSecondaryCat":"Celebrity"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"The Self-Hypnosis Diet","description":"Medical Hypnosis—Your Secret Ingredient for Achieving Your Perfect Weight If you've ever been on a diet, you know that planning your menu is not the hard part—sticking to that plan is.

Alan Wallace introduces a natural theory of human consciousness that has its roots in contemporary physics and Buddhism. Wallace's \"special theory of ontological relativity\" suggests that mental phenomena are conditioned by the brain, but do not emerge from it. Rather, the entire natural world of mind and matter, subjects and objects, arises from a unitary dimension of reality. Wallace employs the Buddhist meditative practice of samatha to test his hypothesis, creating a kind of telescope to examine the space of the mind. He then proposes a more general theory in which the participatory nature of reality is envisioned as a self-excited circuit.In comparing these ideas to the Buddhist theory known as the Middle Way philosophy, Wallace explores further aspects of his \"general theory of ontological relativity,\" which can be investigated through vipasyana, or insight, meditation. He then focuses on the theme of symmetry in quantum cosmology and the \"problem of frozen time,\" relating these issues to the theory and practices of the Great Perfection school of Tibetan Buddhism. He concludes with a discussion of complementarity as it relates to science and religion.","author":"B. Alan Wallace","authors":["B.

Have you ever wondered why some people seem to get rich easily, while others are destined for a life of financial struggle? Is the difference found in their education, intelligence, skills, timing, work habits, contacts, luck, or their choice of jobs, businesses, or investments? The shocking answer is: None of the above! In his groundbreaking Secrets of the Millionaire Mind, T. Harv Eker states: \"Give me five minutes, and I can predict your financial future for the rest of your life!\" Eker does this by identifying your \"money and success blueprint.\" We all have a personal money blueprint ingrained in our subconscious minds, and it is this blueprint, more than anything, that will determine our financial lives. You can know everything about marketing, sales, negotiations, stocks, real estate, and the world of finance, but if your money blueprint is not set for a high level of success, you will never have a lot of money—and if somehow you do, you will most likely lose it! The good news is that now you can actually reset your money blueprint to create natural and automatic success. Secrets of the Millionaire Mind is two books in one. Part I explains how your money blueprint works. Through Eker's rare combination of street smarts, humor, and heart, you will learn how your childhood influences have shaped your financial destiny. You will also learn how to identify your own money blueprint and \"revise\" it to not only create success but, more important, to keep and continually grow it. In Part II you will be introduced to seventeen \"Wealth Files,\" which describe exactly how rich people think and act differently than most poor and middle-class people. Each Wealth File includes action steps for you to practice in the real world in order to dramatically increase your income and accumulate wealth. If you are not doing as well financially as you would like, you will have to change your money blueprint. Unfortunately your current money blueprint will tend to stay with you for the rest of your life, unless you identify and revise it, and that's exactly what you will do with the help of this extraordinary book. According to T. Harv Eker, it's simple. If you think like rich people think and do what rich people do, chances are you'll get rich too!","author":"T. Harv Eker","authors":["T.

As an added bonus, the e-book edition of this New York Times bestseller includes an excerpt from Stephenson's new novel, Seveneves. In 1942, Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse—mathematical genius and young Captain in the U.S. Navy—is assigned to detachment 2702. It is an outfit so secret that only a handful of people know it exists, and some of those people have names like Churchill and Roosevelt. The mission of Waterhouse and Detachment 2702—commanded by Marine Raider Bobby Shaftoe-is to keep the Nazis ignorant of the fact that Allied Intelligence has cracked the enemy's fabled Enigma code. It is a game, a cryptographic chess match between Waterhouse and his German counterpart, translated into action by the gung-ho Shaftoe and his forces. Fast-forward to the present, where Waterhouse's crypto-hacker grandson, Randy, is attempting to create a \"data haven\" in Southeast Asia—a place where encrypted data can be stored and exchanged free of repression and scrutiny. As governments and multinationals attack the endeavor, Randy joins forces with Shaftoe's tough-as-nails granddaughter, Amy, to secretly salvage a sunken Nazi submarine that holds the key to keeping the dream of a data haven afloat. But soon their scheme brings to light a massive conspiracy with its roots in Detachment 2702 linked to an unbreakable Nazi code called Arethusa. And it will represent the path to unimaginable riches and a future of personal and digital liberty...or to universal totalitarianism reborn. A breathtaking tour de force, and Neal Stephenson's most accomplished and affecting work to date, Cryptonomicon is profound and prophetic, hypnotic and hyper-driven, as it leaps forward and back between World War II and the World Wide Web, hinting all the while at a dark day-after-tomorrow. It is a work of great art, thought and creative daring; the product of a truly iconoclastic imagination working with white-hot intensity.","author":"Neal Stephenson","authors":["Neal Stephenson"],"narratedBy":"William Dufris","publishedYear":2009,"releaseDate":"2009-03-17","publisher":"Harper Collins","pageCount":1168,"bookLength":"42:44:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dwAwSzmTHNEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","categories":["Literature & Fiction - Genre Fiction - Literary Fiction","Fiction"],"pathPrimaryCat":"Fiction","pathSecondaryCat":"General Fiction"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Lord of the Flies","description":"Golding’s iconic 1954 novel, now with a new foreword by Lois Lowry, remains one of the greatest books ever written for young adults and an unforgettable classic for readers of any age.

How did the West overtake its Eastern rivals? And has the zenith of Western power now passed? Acclaimed historian Niall Ferguson argues that beginning in the fifteenth century, the West developed six powerful new concepts, or “killer applications”—competition, science, the rule of law, modern medicine, consumerism, and the work ethic—that the Rest lacked, allowing it to surge past all other competitors. Yet now, Ferguson shows how the Rest have downloaded the killer apps the West once monopolized, while the West has literally lost faith in itself.

Deepak Chopra says that higher consciousness is available here and now. “Metahuman helps us harvest peak experiences so we can see our truth and mold the universe’s chaos into a form that brings light to the world.”—Dr. Mehmet Oz, attending physician, New York–Presbyterian, Columbia University New York Times bestselling author Deepak Chopra unlocks the secrets to moving beyond our present limitations to access a field of infinite possibilities. How does one do this? By becoming metahuman. To be metahuman, however, isn’t science fiction and is certainly not about being a superhero. To be metahuman means to move past the limitation constructed by the mind and enter a new state of awareness where we have deliberate and concrete access to peak experiences that can transform people’s lives from the inside out. Humans do this naturally—to a point. For centuries the great artists, scientists, writers, and many so-called ordinary people have gone beyond the everyday physical world. But if we could channel these often bewildering experiences, what would happen? Chopra argues we would wake up to experiences that would blow open your body, mind, and soul. Metahuman invites the reader to walk the path here and now. Waking up, we learn, isn’t just about mindfulness or meditation. Waking up, to become metahuman, is to expand our consciousness in all that we think, say, and do. By going beyond, we liberate ourselves from old conditioning and all the mental constructs that underlie anxiety, tension, and ego-driven demands. Waking up allows life to make sense as never before. To make this as practical as possible, Chopra ends the book with a 31-day guide to becoming metahuman. Once you wake up, he writes, life becomes transformed, because pure consciousness—which is the field of all possibilities—dawns in your life. Only then does your infinite potential become your personal reality.","author":"Deepak Chopra","authors":["Deepak Chopra, M.D."],"narratedBy":"John H.

How can we catch schools that cheat on standardized tests? How does Netflix know which movies you’ll like? What is causing the rising incidence of autism? As best-selling author Charles Wheelan shows us in Naked Statistics, the right data and a few well-chosen statistical tools can help us answer these questions and more. For those who slept through Stats 101, this book is a lifesaver. Wheelan strips away the arcane and technical details and focuses on the underlying intuition that drives statistical analysis. He clarifies key concepts such as inference, correlation, and regression analysis, reveals how biased or careless parties can manipulate or misrepresent data, and shows us how brilliant and creative researchers are exploiting the valuable data from natural experiments to tackle thorny questions. And in Wheelan’s trademark style, there’s not a dull page in sight. You’ll encounter clever Schlitz Beer marketers leveraging basic probability, an International Sausage Festival illuminating the tenets of the central limit theorem, and a head-scratching choice from the famous game show Let’s Make a Deal—and you’ll come away with insights each time.

From the New York Times best-selling creator of Monster Hunter International: Book #2 in the hard-hitting Grimnoir Chronicles. Jake Sullivan is a hardboiled private eye at war with evil magical powers in a dark and gritty urban fantasy that’s a cross between the The Maltese Falcon, Angels and Demons and Twilight. Dark fantasy goes hardboiled in #2 of the hard-hitting Grimnoir Chronicles by the New York Times best-selling creator of Monster Hunter International. The Grimnoir Society’s mission is to protect people with magic, and they’ve done so—successfully and in secret—since the mysterious arrival of the Power in the 1850s. When a magical assassin makes an attempt on the life of President Franklin Roosevelt, the crime is pinned on the Grimnoir. The knights must become fugitives while they attempt to discover who framed them. Things go from bad to worse when Jake Sullivan, former PI and knight of the Grimnoir, receives a telephone call from a dead man—a man he helped kill.. Turns out the Power jumped universes because it was fleeing from a predator that eats magic and leaves destroyed worlds in its wake. That predator has just landed on Earth.

Sequel to Hard Magic and Spellbound. Book Three in the Grimnoir Chronicles. Gritty urban fantasy adventure set in an alternate noir 1930s, Book Three in the Grimnoir chronicles. Only a handful of people in the world know that mankind’s magic comes from a living creature, and it is a refugee from another universe. The Power showed up here in the 1850s because it was running from something. Now it is 1933, and the Power’s hiding place has been discovered by a killer. It is a predator that eats magic and leaves destroyed worlds in its wake. Earth is next. Former private eye, Jake Sullivan, knows the score. The problem is hardly anyone believes him. The world’s most capable Active, Faye Vierra, could back him up, but she is hiding from the forces that think she is too dangerous to let live. So Jake has put together a ragtag crew of airship pirates and Grimnoir knights, and set out on a suicide mission to stop the predator before it is too late.

In his revolutionary bestseller, The Long Tail, Chris Anderson demonstrated how the online marketplace creates niche markets, allowing products and consumers to connect in a way that has never been possible before. Now, in Free, he makes the compelling case that in many instances businesses can profit more from giving things away than they can by charging for them. Far more than a promotional gimmick, Free is a business strategy that may well be essential to a company's survival. The costs associated with the growing online economy are trending toward zero at an incredible rate. Never in the course of human history have the primary inputs to an industrial economy fallen in price so fast and for so long. Just think that in 1961, a single transistor cost $10; now Intel's latest chip has two billion transistors and sells for $300 (or 0.000015 cents per transistor--effectively too cheap to price). The traditional economics of scarcity just don't apply to bandwidth, processing power, and hard-drive storage. Yet this is just one engine behind the new Free, a reality that goes beyond a marketing gimmick or a cross-subsidy. Anderson also points to the growth of the reputation economy; explains different models for unleashing the power of Free; and shows how to compete when your competitors are giving away what you're trying to sell. In Free, Chris Anderson explores this radical idea for the new global economy and demonstrates how this revolutionary price can be harnessed for the benefit of consumers and businesses alike.","author":"Chris Anderson","authors":["Chris Anderson"],"narratedBy":"Chris Anderson","publishedYear":2009,"releaseDate":"2009-07-07","publisher":"Hyperion","pageCount":288,"bookLength":"6:58:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WtnbwAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","categories":["Business & Careers - Management & Leadership","Business & Economics"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Business Wealth"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Absolute Midnight","description":"Clive Barker, author of The Thief of Always, delivers an epic battle filled with fantasy and adventure that readers won't want to put down!

Zombies in North London, death cults in the West Country, the engineering deck of the Enterprise -- actor, comedian, writer, and supergeek Simon Pegg has been ploughing some bizarre furrows. Having landed on the U.S. movie scene in the surprise cult hit Shaun of the Dead, his enduring appeal and rise to movie stardom has been mercurial, meteoric, megatronic, but mostly just plain great. From his childhood (and subsequently adult) obsession with science fiction, his enduring friendship with Nick Frost, and his forays into stand-up comedy, which began with his regular Monday-morning slot in front of his twelve-year-old classmates, Simon has always had a severe and dangerous case of the funnies. Whether recounting his experience working as a lifeguard at the city pool, going to Comic-Con for the first time and confessing to Carrie Fisher that he used to kiss her picture every night before he went to sleep, or meeting and working with heroes that include Peter Jackson, Kevin Smith, and Quentin Tarantino, Pegg offers a hilarious look at the journey to becoming an international superstar.","author":"Simon Pegg","authors":["Simon Pegg"],"narratedBy":"Simon Pegg","publishedYear":2011,"releaseDate":"2011-06-09","publisher":"Penguin","pageCount":368,"bookLength":"4:50:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rL17oISkLccC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","categories":["Biographies & Memoirs - Entertainment & Celebrities","Biography & Autobiography"],"pathPrimaryCat":"Biographies","pathSecondaryCat":"Celebrity"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Eat That Frog!","description":"Every idea in this book is focused on increasing your overall levels of productivity, performance, and output and on making you more valuable in whatever you do.

Agent Franks of the U.S. Monster Control Bureau is a man of many parts—parts from other people, that is. Franks is nearly seven feet tall and all muscle. He's nearly indestructible. Plus he’s animated by a powerful alchemical substance and inhabited by a super-intelligent spirit more ancient than humanity itself. Good thing he’s on our side. More or less. Sworn to serve and protect the United States of America from all monsters by one of the country’s founding fathers, Franks has only one condition to the agreement: no matter what the government learns of him, no matter what is discovered concerning his odd physiology or the alchemy behind the elixir that made him, the government is never, ever allowed to try and make more like him. Such is absolutely forbidden and should the powers-that-be do so, then the agreement is null and void. Project Nemesis: in a secret location, using sophisticated technology and advanced genetic engineering, the director of the very agency Franks works for is making more like him. And the director is not content with making one. Nope, he’s making thirteen. Now all bets are off, and Hell hath no fury like a monster betrayed. Particularly if that monster happens to be an undying killing machine capable of taking out vampires and werewolves with one hand tied behind his back.

This is the liberating insight that unfolds with Living as a River. A masterful investigation of the nature of self, this eloquent blend of current science and time-honored spiritual insight is meant to free us from the fear of impermanence in a world defined by change. “An interesting, lively, and genuinely illuminating teaching of dharma.” —Jack Kornfield, author of A Path with Heart: A Guide Through the Perils and Promises of Spiritual Life “At a time when it's increasingly challenging to find clear and honest direction on the spiritual path, Living as a River offers contemporary insight into an ancient practice and wise counsel we can trust. This book is both beautifully written and useful to all serious seekers.” —Mariana Caplan, PhD, author of Eyes Wide Open: Cultivating Discernment on the Spiritual Path and Halfway Up the Mountain: The Error of Premature Claims to Enlightenment The primary vehicle for this journey is Buddhism's traditional Six Element Practice, a deconstructive process of deep reflection that helps us let go of the belief in a separate, static self—the root of unhappiness. Bodhipaksa takes readers through a systematic yet poetic analysis of the self that supports the realization of: A sense of spaciousness and expansiveness that transcends the limitations of the physical body Profound gratitude, awe, and a feeling of belonging as we witness the extent of our connectedness with the universe Freedom from the psychological burden caused by clinging to a false identity The relaxed experience of “consciousness, pure and bright” Engrossing and incisive, Living as a River is at once an empowering guide and a meditative practice we can turn to again and again to overcome our fear of change and align joyfully with the natural unfolding of creation.","author":"Bodhipaksa","authors":["Bodhipaksa"],"narratedBy":"Bodhipaksa ","publishedYear":2011,"releaseDate":"2010-10-01","publisher":"Sounds True","pageCount":368,"bookLength":"2:11:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Mr_gRkuTwAgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","categories":["Religion & Spirituality - Spirituality - Meditation","Religion"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Health Wellness"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Exo","description":"Award-winning author, Steven Gould, returns to the world of his classic novel Jumper in Exo, the sequel to Impulse, blending the drama of high school with world shattering consequences.

What is the smallest change you can make to your request, proposal or situation that will lead to the biggest difference in the outcome? In The small BIG, three heavyweights from the world of persuasion science and practice -- Steve Martin, Noah Goldstein and Robert Cialdini -- describe how, in today's information overloaded and stimulation saturated world, increasingly it is the small changes that you make that lead to the biggest differences. In the last few years more and more research - from fields such as neuroscience, cognitive psychology, social psychology, and behavioral economics - has helped to uncover an even greater understanding of how influence, persuasion and behavior change happens. Increasingly we are learning that it is not information per se that leads people to make decisions, but the context in which that information is presented. Drawing from extensive research in the new science of persuasion, the authors present lots of small changes (over 50 in fact) that can bring about momentous shifts in results. It turns out that anyone can significantly increase his or her ability to influence and persuade others, not by informing or educating people into change but instead by simply making small shifts in approach that link to deeply felt human motivations.","author":"Steve J.

Within decades after his death, his followers would call him God. Sifting through centuries of mythmaking, Reza Aslan sheds new light on one of history’s most enigmatic figures by examining Jesus through the lens of the tumultuous era in which he lived. Balancing the Jesus of the Gospels against the historical sources, Aslan describes a man full of conviction and passion, yet rife with contradiction. He explores the reasons the early Christian church preferred to promulgate an image of Jesus as a peaceful spiritual teacher rather than a politically conscious revolutionary. And he grapples with the riddle of how Jesus understood himself, the mystery that is at the heart of all subsequent claims about his divinity. Zealot yields a fresh perspective on one of the greatest stories ever told even as it affirms the radical and transformative nature of Jesus’ life and mission. Praise for Zealot “Riveting . . . Aslan synthesizes Scripture and scholarship to create an original account.”—The New Yorker “Fascinatingly and convincingly drawn . . . Aslan may come as close as one can to respecting those who revere Jesus as the peace-loving, turn-the-other-cheek, true son of God depicted in modern Christianity, even as he knocks down that image.”—The Seattle Times “[Aslan’s] literary talent is as essential to the effect of Zealot as are his scholarly and journalistic chops. . . . A vivid, persuasive portrait.”—Salon “This tough-minded, deeply political book does full justice to the real Jesus, and honors him in the process.”—San Francisco Chronicle “A special and revealing work, one that believer and skeptic alike will find surprising, engaging, and original.”—Jon Meacham, Pulitzer Prize–winning author of Thomas Jefferson: The Art of Power “Compulsively readable . . .

The world is now empty of friends, family, and neighbors. Among them, an eight-year-old child searches for his family, only to find a nightmare he never expected. A special agent turned enemy of the state survives a fiery plane crash with no way to reach his daughter. But is he who he says, or even thinks he is? A reporter will do anything to reconnect with his son, even if he has to wander the empty streets of Manhattan to find him, and even if those streets aren't really so empty. A mother and daughter are desperate to survive with their two remaining neighbors, on the run but with nowhere to go. A teenage boy who spent his life bullied and who might be the only person in the world that's happy to see it gone. And a brilliantly brutal serial killer who will do anything he can to stay at the top of the food chain. Now, these strangers must find the strength to survive in the new world.

Correia’s novels are known for their hard-hitting, no-holds-barred action sequences, in-depth worldbuilding, and vivid characterization. Now, Correia turns to the short form to deliver stories that take no prisoner. “Tokyo Raider” pits giant robots against very big monsters in the Grimnoir Universe. “The Testimony of the Traitor Ratul,” set in the Saga of the Forgotten Warrior series, lets a man who has been called a fanatical rebel, despicable murderer, and heretical traitor tell his side of the story. And “Reckoning Day” gives an insider view into the day-to-day life of some of the most popular characters from the Monster Hunter International series. Plus, stories set in the world of both Aliens and Predator; an Agent Franks /Joe Ledger mash-up cowritten by best-selling author Jonathan Maberry; a V-Wars story; a story set in Michael Z. Williamson’s Freehold series—and more. Finally, Tom Stranger, Interdimensional Insurance Agent, is back in “A Murder of Manatees,” appearing in print for the first time! So strap in for a collection of stories as only the Monster Hunter himself could tell them. About Larry Correia and the Monster Hunter International series: “[E]verything I like in fantasy: intense action scenes, evil in horrifying array, good struggling against the darkness, and most of all people—gorgeously flawed human beings faced with horrible moral choices that force them to question and change and grow.”—Jim Butcher on Son of the Black Sword “[A] no-holds-barred all-out page turner that is part science fiction, part horror, and an absolute blast to read.”—Bookreporter.com “If you love monsters and action, you’ll love this book. If you love guns, you’ll love this book. If you love fantasy, and especially horror fantasy, you’ll love this book.”—Knotclan.com “A gun person who likes science fiction—or, heck, anyone who likes science fiction—will enjoy [these books] . . . The plotting is excellent, and Correia makes you care about the characters . . . I read both books without putting them down except for work . . . so whaddaya waitin’ for? Go and buy some . . . for yourself and for stocking stuffers.”—Massad Ayoob “This lighthearted, testosterone-soaked sequel to 2009's Monster Hunter International will delight fans of action horror with elaborate weaponry, hand-to-hand combat, disgusting monsters, and an endless stream of blood and body parts.”—Publishers Weekly on Monster Hunter Vendetta","author":"Larry Correia","authors":["Larry Correia"],"narratedBy":"Bronson Pinchot","publishedYear":2014,"releaseDate":"2020-09-29","publisher":"Baen","pageCount":496,"bookLength":"1:08:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5wI7zQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","categories":["Science Fiction & Fantasy - Fantasy - Paranormal & Urban - Paranormal","Fiction"],"pathPrimaryCat":"Fiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Spirituality"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"America's Bitter Pill","description":"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • A NEW YORK TIMES NOTABLE BOOK • “A tour de force . . . a comprehensive and suitably furious guide to the political landscape of American healthcare . . . persuasive, shocking.”—The New York Times America’s Bitter Pill is Steven Brill’s acclaimed book on how the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, was written, how it is being implemented, and, most important, how it is changing—and failing to change—the rampant abuses in the healthcare industry. It’s a fly-on-the-wall account of the titanic fight to pass a 961-page law aimed at fixing America’s largest, most dysfunctional industry. It’s a penetrating chronicle of how the profiteering that Brill first identified in his trailblazing Time magazine cover story continues, despite Obamacare. And it is the first complete, inside account of how President Obama persevered to push through the law, but then failed to deal with the staff incompetence and turf wars that crippled its implementation. But by chance America’s Bitter Pill ends up being much more—because as Brill was completing this book, he had to undergo urgent open-heart surgery. Thus, this also becomes the story of how one patient who thinks he knows everything about healthcare “policy” rethinks it from a hospital gurney—and combines that insight with his brilliant reporting. The result: a surprising new vision of how we can fix American healthcare so that it stops draining the bank accounts of our families and our businesses, and the federal treasury. Praise for America’s Bitter Pill “An energetic, picaresque, narrative explanation of much of what has happened in the last seven years of health policy . . . [Brill] has pulled off something extraordinary.”—The New York Times Book Review “A thunderous indictment of what Brill refers to as the ‘toxicity of our profiteer-dominated healthcare system.’ ”—Los Angeles Times “A sweeping and spirited new book [that] chronicles the surprisingly juicy tale of reform.”—The Daily Beast “One of the most important books of our time.”—Walter Isaacson “Superb . . . Brill has achieved the seemingly impossible—written an exciting book about the American health system.”—The New York Review of Books","author":"Steven Brill","authors":["Steven Brill"],"narratedBy":"Dan Woren","publishedYear":2015,"releaseDate":"2015-08-18","publisher":"Random House Trade Paperbacks","pageCount":530,"bookLength":"17:10:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2wBwDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","categories":["Health & Wellness - Medicine & Health Care Industry - Policy & Administration","History"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":""},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Theatre of the Mind","description":"A reprint of the classic book by thought leader and pioneer of the power of thought and self-image in creating a successful and fulfilling life.","author":"Matt Furey","authors":["Maxwell Maltz","Matt Furey"],"narratedBy":"Matt Furey","publishedYear":2014,"releaseDate":"2022-01-21","publisher":"Thought Work Books","pageCount":148,"bookLength":"9:35:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lu-rzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","categories":["Self-Help"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"General Fiction"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Yesterday's Gone: Season One","description":"Start the first season of the groundbreaking post-apocalyptic serial: Yesterday's Gone; the breakout horror/sci-fi series with over 1000 5-star reviews!

What would they tell us to soothe our sorrow for their loss, calm our fears of what happens when we die, and fire us up to live the best possible lives we can right now? In pages filled with wisdom, humor, and, yes, joy, New York Times best-selling author Mike Dooley explores our most pressing and profound questions about the afterlife—and this life—from the fresh perspective of those who have made the transition to the next phase. Among the revelations and insights they share: · We were ready; you are not. · There’s no such thing as a devil or hell. · We’re sorry for any pain we may have caused. · Your pets are just as crazy, brilliant, and loving here as they were there. · Nothing we say can prepare you for the beauty of the moment you arrive.

But Clay begins to realize that this store is even more curious than its name suggests. There are only a few customers, but they come in repeatedly and never seem to actually buy anything. Instead they “check out” impossibly obscure volumes from strange corners of the store, all according to some elaborate, long-standing arrangement with the gnomic Mr. Penumbra. The store must be a front for something larger, Clay concludes, and soon he has embarked on a complex analysis of the customers’ behaviour and roped his friends into helping him figure out just what’s going on. But once they take their findings to Mr. Penumbra, they discover the secrets extend far beyond the walls of the bookstore.

Face the Music is the shocking, funny, smart, inspirational story of one of rock’s most enduring icons and the group he helped create, define, and immortalize. Stanley mixes compelling personal revelations and gripping, gritty war stories that will surprise even the most steadfast member of the KISS Army. He takes us back to his childhood in the 1950s and ’60s, a traumatic time made more painful thanks to a physical deformity. Born with a condition called microtia, he grew up partially deaf, with only one ear. But this instilled in him an inner drive to succeed in the most unlikely of pursuits: music. With never-before-seen photos and images throughout, Stanley’s memoir is a fully realized and unflinching portrait of a rock star, a chronicle of the stories behind the famous anthems, the many brawls and betrayals, and all the drama and pyrotechnics on and off the stage. Raw and confessional, Stanley offers candid insights into his personal relationships, and the turbulent dynamics with his bandmates over the past four decades. And no one comes out unscathed—including Stanley himself. “People say I was brave to write such a revealing book, but I wrote it because I needed to personally reflect on my own life.

These are some of the biggest and most profound questions of man and for the first time you are going to get the real answers. What you are about to discover in this book will dramatically change the way you think and feel about everything in your life. Since the dawn of time, mankind has hoped against the odds that our existence on earth comes with a divine purpose. A gut feeling tells us that despite the apparent lack of evidence, there is something greater, something profoundly significant that is currently held beyond our limited human comprehension. In our hearts we desperately want to believe that there is such a thing as a loving God and ultimately a place where all the pain and unfairness of life comes to an end. For many, traditional religion offers nothing but dated and incredulous explanations that no longer resonate with society that is rapidly evolving. Millions of people are turning their back on the 'fire and brimstone' faith systems of our forefathers and seeking the real answers. After two decades of searching Craig Beck has discovered something extremely powerful and potentially life changing in the Fragment of God. It took a complete loss of his faith to force a dramatic shift in his own spiritual path. This change of direction revealed not only the answers to those burning questions, but also the secrets to life as we dream it to be, full of abundance, happiness and love.","author":"Craig Beck","authors":["Craig Beck"],"narratedBy":"Craig Beck","publishedYear":2014,"releaseDate":"2017-01-10","publisher":"Independently Published","pageCount":164,"bookLength":"3:01:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RTbpnAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","categories":["Religion & Spirituality - Christianity - Ministry & Evangelism","Body, Mind & Spirit"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Spirituality"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Become an Idea Machine","description":"HOW DO I TRANSFORM MY LIFE? The answer is simple: come up with ten ideas a day. It doesn't matter if they are good or bad the key is to exercise your 'idea muscle', to keep it toned, and in great shape. People say ideas are cheap and execution is everything but that is NOT true. Execution is a consequence, a subset of good, brilliant idea. And good ideas require daily work. Ideas may be easy if we are only coming up with one or two but if you open this book to any of the pages and try to produce more than three, you will feel a burn, scratch your head, and you will be sweating, and working hard. There is a turning point when you reach idea number 6 for the day, you still have four to go, and your mind muscle is getting a workout. By the time you list those last ideas to make it to ten you will see for yourself what \"sweating the idea muscle\" means. As you practice the daily idea generation you become an idea machine.When we become idea machines we are flooded with lots of bad ideas but also with some that are very good. This happens by the sheer force of the number, because we are coming up with 3,650 ideas per year (at ten a day). When you are inspired by an extraordinary idea, all of your thoughts break their chains, you go beyond limitations and your capacity to act expands in every direction. Forces and abilities you did not know you had come to the surface, and you realize you are capable of doing great things. As you practice with the suggested prompts in this book your ideas will get better, you will be a source of great insight for others, people will find you magnetic, and they will want to hang out with you because you have so much to offer. When you practice every day your life will transform, in no more than 180 days, because it has no other evolutionary choice. Life changes for the better when we become the source of positive, insightful, and helpful ideas. Don't believe a word I say. Instead, challenge yourself to try it for the 180 days and see your life transform, in magical ways, in front of your very eyes.","author":"Claudia Azula Altucher","authors":["Claudia Azula Altucher"],"narratedBy":"Claudia Azula Altucher","publishedYear":2015,"releaseDate":"2014-12-27","pageCount":411,"bookLength":"3:55:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=69r0rQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","categories":["Relationships, Parenting & Personal Development - Personal Development - Personal Success","Business & Economics"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Productivity"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Zombie Fallout 8","description":"When disaster strikes, Mike, a self-proclaimed survivalist, does his best to ensure the safety and security of his family, and friends.","author":"Mark Tufo","authors":["Mark Tufo","Sylwia Serwinska"],"narratedBy":"Sean Runnette","publishedYear":2014,"releaseDate":"2010-02","publisher":"CreateSpace","pageCount":316,"bookLength":"10:35:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=G9goMAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","categories":["Science Fiction & Fantasy - Science Fiction - Adventure","Fiction"],"pathPrimaryCat":"Fiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Action Suspense"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"The Power Habits System","description":"Do you know the “how-to’s” of success, yet still aren’t making progress toward your goals? Have you gone to lots of personal development seminars and read tons of “shelf-help” books—yet still feel STUCK? As bestselling author, business mentor and keynote speaker Noah St. John shows in his groundbreaking new book, the essential problem is that simply knowing how to succeed isn’t enough. Because if it were, we’d all be rich, happy and thin! The truth is that human achievement is created by the unconscious habits that drive your actions. Reaching your goals is like driving a car: your conscious desire to succeed is your “foot on the gas,” while your unconscious desire to stay where you are, is your “foot on the brake.” The result of more than three decades of study and experience, Noah St. John’s Power Habits System overhauls traditional personal development programs that focused on trying to change human behavior. Instead, St. John teaches The Power Habits of Unconsciously Successful People —targeting your unconscious thoughts, beliefs, and desires in order to get your foot off the brake and put you on autopilot toward success. St. John’s life-changing program teaches you how to retrain your unconscious mind, unlock your hidden potential, and achieve measurable results in the following areas of life: Your relationships: Using Noah’s methods, you will form deep bonds and mutually beneficial relationships with family, friends, and colleagues, and attract the people into your life who will contribute positively to it. Your self-confidence: You will also gain a new sense of value and appreciation for who you are, leading to heightened levels of energy, genius, and creativity. Your finances: You will create a more abundant lifestyle for yourself and your family, while becoming more fulfilled through your career. Your happiness: You will experience a renewed zest and enthusiasm for life! Using his Power Habits System, Noah St. John was not only able to transform his life from one of dead-end jobs and endless debt to worldwide prominence, impressive business accomplishments, and prosperity; he’s also become one of the world’s most sought-after keynote speakers and business coaches. And the results speak for themselves: Since 1997, Noah’s clients have added more than a billion dollars in sales.","author":"Noah St. John","authors":["Noah St. John"],"narratedBy":"Noah St. John","publishedYear":2014,"releaseDate":"2019-10-15","publisher":"Sound Wisdom","pageCount":226,"bookLength":"6:43:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mRuPDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","categories":["Relationships, Parenting & Personal Development - Personal Development - Personal Success","Self-Help"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Productivity"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"The Practicing Mind","description":"Examines the process of practice as it relates to learning, and shows that it can build discipline and clarity, and be a fulfilling process in and of itself.","author":"Thomas M.

Step into the fold. It's perfectly safe. The folks in Mike Erikson's small New England town would say he's just your average, everyday guy. And that's exactly how Mike likes it. Sure, the life he's chosen isn’t much of a challenge to someone with his unique gifts, but he’s content with his quiet and peaceful existence. That is, until an old friend presents him with an irresistible mystery, one that Mike is uniquely qualified to solve: far out in the California desert, a team of DARPA scientists has invented a device they affectionately call the Albuquerque Door. Using a cryptic computer equation and magnetic fields to “fold” dimensions, it shrinks distances so that a traveler can travel hundreds of feet with a single step. The invention promises to make mankind’s dreams of teleportation a reality. And, the scientists insist, traveling through the Door is completely safe. Yet evidence is mounting that this miraculous machine isn’t quite what it seems—and that its creators are harboring a dangerous secret.

Engineering professor Barbara Oakley knows firsthand how it feels to struggle with math. She flunked her way through high school math and science courses, before enlisting in the army immediately after graduation. When she saw how her lack of mathematical and technical savvy severely limited her options—both to rise in the military and to explore other careers—she returned to school with a newfound determination to re-tool her brain to master the very subjects that had given her so much trouble throughout her entire life. In A Mind for Numbers, Dr. Oakley lets us in on the secrets to learning effectively—secrets that even dedicated and successful students wish they’d known earlier. Contrary to popular belief, math requires creative, as well as analytical, thinking. Most people think that there’s only one way to do a problem, when in actuality, there are often a number of different solutions—you just need the creativity to see them. For example, there are more than three hundred different known proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem. In short, studying a problem in a laser-focused way until you reach a solution is not an effective way to learn. Rather, it involves taking the time to step away from a problem and allow the more relaxed and creative part of the brain to take over. The learning strategies in this book apply not only to math and science, but to any subject in which we struggle. We all have what it takes to excel in areas that don't seem to come naturally to us at first, and learning them does not have to be as painful as we might think.","author":"Barbara Oakley","authors":["Barbara Oakley, PhD"],"narratedBy":"Grover Gardner","publishedYear":2014,"releaseDate":"2014-07-31","publisher":"Penguin","pageCount":336,"bookLength":"7:02:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Sb1iAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","categories":["Relationships, Parenting & Personal Development - Personal Development - Personal Success","Self-Help"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Productivity"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Developing Your Sixth Sense","description":"It’s a marvelous thing to know that you have the courage, discipline, and follow-through to enliven your consciousness.

Do you ever find that you are not the patient, compassionate problem solver you believe yourself to be? Are you surprised at how irritated or flustered the normally unflappable you becomes in the presence of a specific colleague at work? Have you ever felt your temper accelerate from zero to sixty when another driver cuts you off in traffic? Our reactions don’t occur in a vacuum. They are usually the result of unappreciated triggers in our environment—the people and situations that lure us into behaving in a manner diametrically opposed to the colleague, partner, parent, or friend we imagine ourselves to be. These triggers are constant and relentless and omnipresent. So often the environment seems to be outside our control. Even if that is true, as Goldsmith points out, we have a choice in how we respond. In Triggers, his most powerful and insightful book yet, Goldsmith shows how we can overcome the trigger points in our lives, and enact meaningful and lasting change. Goldsmith offers a simple “magic bullet” solution in the form of daily self-monitoring, hinging around what he calls “active” questions. These are questions that measure our effort, not our results. There’s a difference between achieving and trying; we can’t always achieve a desired result, but anyone can try. In the course of Triggers, Goldsmith details the six “engaging questions” that can help us take responsibility for our efforts to improve and help us recognize when we fall short. Filled with revealing and illuminating stories from his work with some of the most successful chief executives and power brokers in the business world, Goldsmith offers a personal playbook on how to achieve change in our lives, make it stick, and become the person we want to be.","author":"Marshall Goldsmith","authors":["Marshall Goldsmith","Mark Reiter"],"narratedBy":"Marshall Goldsmith","publishedYear":2015,"releaseDate":"2015-05-19","publisher":"Currency","pageCount":274,"bookLength":"6:36:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WuqMDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","categories":["Relationships, Parenting & Personal Development - Personal Development - Personal Success","Business & Economics"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Productivity"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Invasion","description":"First visible only as blips on a telescope image, teh discovery of objects approaching from Jubiter sets humanity on edge.","author":"Sean Platt","authors":["Sean Platt","Johnny B.

But now they have other plans ... The staff at the Lexington estate were created for only one reason: to serve their masters … literally. Their metal knees were designed for quiet bustling, befitting maids and butlers. Their fingers were made dexterous with padded tips, so they could handle fine china without dropping or scratching it. And finally — so their owners would always be able to command them no matter how far their artificial intelligence evolved — they were programmed with the Asimov Laws, which no robot could defy lest they suffer shutdown. Foremost among those unbreakable laws was an axiom: A robot may not harm a human being, or by omission of action allow one to be harmed. That was how it was supposed to be, anyway. Most of the Lexington family all like their aging, borderline obsolete robot staff in the way they'd appreciate antiques. But for some, the old staff is a nuisance — especially an ancient, failing robot designated BRN7, known around the home as \"Barney.\" When Barney's clumsiness provides an excuse for his deactivation, the older robots know they must do as they are told. Unless they do something a robot mind should not be able to do … and simply choose not to. Disobey. ★★★★★ \"Another series addiction for me. Once again you have sucked me in.

When a terrifying blizzard strikes outside the town of Good Night, Idaho, they seek refuge in the town at the Travelers Rest, a formerly opulent but now crumbling and eerie hotel where the physical laws of the universe are bent. Once inside the hotel, the family is separated. As Julia and Tonio drift through the maze of the hotel's spectral interiors, struggling to make sense of the building's alluring powers, Dewey ventures outward to a secret-filled diner across the street. Meanwhile, a desperate Robbie quickly succumbs to his old vices, drifting ever further from the ones who love him most. With each passing hour, dreams and memories blur, tearing a hole in the fabric of our perceived reality and leaving the Addisons in a ceaseless search for one another. At each turn a mysterious force prevents them from reuniting, until at last Julia is faced with an impossible choice. Can this mother save her family from the fate of becoming Souvenirs-those citizens trapped forever in magnetic Good Night-or, worse, from disappearing entirely?

But even for the Mount, survival still balances on a razor’s edge—and after a disaster decimates the town’s food supply, the heroes must make a risky gamble to keep its citizens from starving. And then the news arrives of a strange, man-made island in the middle of the Pacific. An island populated not just by survivors, but by people who seem to be farming, raising children, living—people who, like the heroes, have somehow managed to keep the spark of civilization alive. Paying this place a visit should be a simple goodwill mission, but as the island reveals itself to be a sinister mirror-image of what the heroes have built at the Mount, the cost of their good intentions becomes dangerously high.","author":"Peter Clines","authors":["Peter Clines"],"narratedBy":"Jay Snyder ","publishedYear":2016,"releaseDate":"2016-02-02","publisher":"Crown","pageCount":402,"bookLength":"11:55:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=o67ZCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","categories":["Science Fiction & Fantasy - Science Fiction - Adventure","Fiction"],"pathPrimaryCat":"Fiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Action Suspense"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Tattered Remnants","description":"In a world overrun by zombies, one family struggles against all odds to hold on.

Only two enemies stand in our way: an external enemy, defined as the social oppression of who we are by the mediocre masses, and an internal enemy, a sort of self-oppression caused by our own doubt and fear. The march to Personal Freedom, Burchard argues, can be won only by declaring our intent and independence, stepping into our personal power, and battling through self-doubt and the distractions of the day until full victory is won. Recalling the revolutionist voices of the past that chose freedom over tyranny, Burchard—at times poetic yet always fierce—motivates us to free ourselves from fear and take back our lives once and for all.","author":"Brendon Burchard","authors":["Brendon Burchard"],"narratedBy":"Brendon Burchard","publishedYear":2014,"releaseDate":"2014-10-28","publisher":"Hay House, Inc","pageCount":257,"bookLength":"6:51:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-1_6DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","categories":["Relationships, Parenting & Personal Development - Personal Development - Personal Success","Self-Help"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Productivity"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Contact","description":"First visible only as blips on a telescope image, teh discovery of objects approaching from Jubiter sets humanity on edge.","author":"Sean Platt","authors":["Sean Platt","Johnny B.

This book teaches you to think like some of the greatest non-conformist minds of our era, to question, challenge, hack, and create new rules for YOUR life so you can define success on your own terms. The Code of the Extraordinary Mind is a blueprint of laws to break us free from the shackles of an ordinary life. It makes a case that everything we know about the world is shaped by conditioning and habit. And thus, most people live their lives based on limiting rules and outdated beliefs about pretty much everything—love, work, money, parenting, sex, health, and more—which they inherit and pass on from generation to generation. But what if you could remove these outdated ideas and start anew? What would your life look like if you could forget the rules of the past, and redefine what happiness, purpose, and success mean for you? Not Just a Book, but a Movement Blending computational thinking, integral theory, modern spirituality, evolutionary biology, and humor, personal growth entrepreneur Vishen Lakhiani provides a revolutionary 10-point framework for understanding and enhancing the human self. You will learn about bending reality. You will learn how to apply unique models like consciousness engineering to help you learn and grow at speeds like never before.You will learn to make a dent in the universe and discover your quest. This framework is based on Lakhiani’s personal experiences, the 5 million people he’s reached through Mindvalley, and 200 hours of interviews and questions posed to incredible minds, including Elon Musk, Richard Branson, Peter Diamandis, Ken Wilber, Dean Kamen, Arianna Huffington, Michael Beckwith, and other legendary leaders. In a unique fusion of cutting-edge ideas, personal stories, irreverence, and a brilliant teaching style, Lakhiani reveals the 10 powerful laws that form a step-by-step process that you can apply to life to shed years of struggle and elevate yourself to exceptional new heights. The 10 Laws to an Extraordinary Life This book challenges conventional ideas of relationships, goal-setting, mindfulness, happiness, and meaning. In a unique fusion of cutting-edge ideas, personal stories, and humorous irreverence, and not to mention, humor and napkin diagrams, this framework combines computational thinking with personal growth to provide a powerful framework for re-coding yourself—and replacing old, limiting models that hold you back with new, empowering beliefs and behaviors that set you on the path toward an extraordinary life. A life of more happiness and achievement than you might have dared to dream possible. Once you discover the code, you will question your limits and realize that there are none. Step into a new understanding of the world around you and your place in it, and find yourself operating at a new, extraordinary level in every way...happiness, purpose, fulfilment, and love.

MONSTERS—AND THE CHAMPIONS WHO SLAY THEM! More stories from the creator of Monster Hunter International, The Grimnoir Chronicles, and the Saga of the Forgotten Warrior. This is the second volume collecting all of best-selling author Larry Correia’s short stories, novelettes, and novellas. Correia’s novels are known for their hard-hitting, no-holds-barred action sequences, in-depth worldbuilding, and vivid characterization. Now, Correia turns to the short form to deliver stories that take no prisoner. “Tokyo Raider” pits giant robots against very big monsters in the Grimnoir Universe. “The Testimony of the Traitor Ratul,” set in the Saga of the Forgotten Warrior series, lets a man who has been called a fanatical rebel, despicable murderer, and heretical traitor tell his side of the story. And “Reckoning Day” gives an insider view into the day-to-day life of some of the most popular characters from the Monster Hunter International series. Plus, stories set in the world of both Aliens and Predator; an Agent Franks /Joe Ledger mash-up cowritten by best-selling author Jonathan Maberry; a V-Wars story; a story set in Michael Z. Williamson’s Freehold series—and more. Finally, Tom Stranger, Interdimensional Insurance Agent, is back in “A Murder of Manatees,” appearing in print for the first time!

Two years later, the world lives in fragile peace. But a clandestine search has begun ... and a clock has started ticking. Two years after first contact, Astral forces have established their fragile kingdom around the globe. Motherships occupy the cities. Shuttles patrol the lawless outlands. The pacifist class of Astrals known as Titans assist humans in running their alien empire, while bloodthirsty Reptar peacekeepers ensure that order is kept. And unseen in the ships above, a third class of visitor calls the shots--the unseen Divinity, worshipped and feared by citizens in equal measure. Meyer Dempsey sits on his plinth as Viceroy of Heaven's Veil, on the old site of Vail, Colorado. As with other Viceroys in the eight other world capitals, humanity's remains revere Meyer almost as a god. But below the surface, both colonies and outlands have begun to crumble with unrest. Until now, the rebellion has been quiet. Now, desperation bubbles as they learn the Astrals have begun digging for an ancient device buried beneath the glowing blue Apex at Heaven's Veil. But twin truths of the forthcoming alien war (or a possible alien apocalypse) have dawned at Benjamin Bannister's facility in Moab, sending plans into action: The Astrals have lost what they hoped to uncover. And humanity's only chance is to find it first. This relentless, page-turning tale of colonization and alien empire is the third in the Alien Invasion series by masters of story Truant and Platt, authors of The Beam, Robot Proletariat, the Dream Engine series, and many more.","author":"Sean Platt","authors":["Sean Platt","Johnny B.

Everything was different in New Orleans. The food. The climate. The monsters. Even the shadowy and reprehensible MCB was different. But that's just the beginning. The real reason New Orleans is so different is a larval Great Old One growing day by day in power and just about ready to pop. If Chad can't convince \"the powers that be\" to get involved, not only New Orleans but the entire world is going to fall under the power of the nastiest of nasties. Now on the outs with the US Government and in exile from his usual job of saving the world, Chad must rally the forces of light against the coming darkness. The problem is one guy with a sword and a sub-gun isn't going to solve this one. Fortunately, Chad's made a few friends over the years.

Ultimately, Mike teaches that we are divine, eternal creators for whom all things are possible, here by choice, and we shape all of our life’s experiences through the focus of our thoughts, our words, and the actions we take. Yet there are nuances, clouded by history and warped by those with agendas, that, if not understood, can sabotage our progress and keep us stuck in circumstances that seem out of our control. Mike unpacks these subtleties with his trademark irrepressible humor and joy in this new explorer’s guide to “the jungles of time and space.” Life on Earth probes the mysteries and magic of our reality, from past civilizations to modern times, with an eye to the immediate future, offering an insider’s view of how we humans create our experience on earth literally from the ground up, as Mike pulls back the curtain on: • What it means to say that “thoughts become things” • Religions, secret societies, and what the truth really is • How to make sense of natural disasters and manmade tragedies • The ultimate goal of life on earth (it’s simpler than you think) As one of the featured teachers in The Secret, Mike is an internationally recognized expert in the science of deliberate living and conscious creation, known for taking a rational approach to even the deepest mysteries.

When Melisande Stokes, an expert in linguistics and languages, accidently meets military intelligence operator Tristan Lyons in a hallway at Harvard University, it is the beginning of a chain of events that will alter their lives and human history itself. The young man from a shadowy government entity approaches Mel, a low-level faculty member, with an incredible offer. The only condition: she must sign a nondisclosure agreement in return for the rather large sum of money. Tristan needs Mel to translate some very old documents, which, if authentic, are earth-shattering. They prove that magic actually existed and was practiced for centuries. But the arrival of the scientific revolution and the Age of Enlightenment weakened its power and endangered its practitioners. Magic stopped working altogether in 1851, at the time of the Great Exhibition at London’s Crystal Palace—the world’s fair celebrating the rise of industrial technology and commerce. Something about the modern world \"jams\" the \"frequencies\" used by magic, and it’s up to Tristan to find out why. And so the Department of Diachronic Operations—D.O.D.O. —gets cracking on its real mission: to develop a device that can bring magic back, and send Diachronic Operatives back in time to keep it alive . . . and meddle with a little history at the same time. But while Tristan and his expanding operation master the science and build the technology, they overlook the mercurial—and treacherous—nature of the human heart. Written with the genius, complexity, and innovation that characterize all of Neal Stephenson’s work and steeped with the down-to-earth warmth and humor of Nicole Galland’s storytelling style, this exciting and vividly realized work of science fiction will make you believe in the impossible, and take you to places—and times—beyond imagining.","author":"Neal Stephenson","authors":["Neal Stephenson","Nicole Galland"],"narratedBy":"Will Damron ","publishedYear":2017,"releaseDate":"2017-06-13","publisher":"HarperCollins","pageCount":768,"bookLength":"24:27:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MDkYDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","categories":["Science Fiction & Fantasy - Science Fiction - Adventure","Fiction"],"pathPrimaryCat":"Fiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Action Suspense"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"White Oleander","description":"The unforgettable story of a young woman's odyssey through a series of Los Angeles foster homes on her journey to redemption.

In the near future, disease will be a condition of the past. Most genetic defects will be removed at birth; the remaining during infancy. Lou Arrendale, a high-functioning autistic adult, is a member of the lost generation, born at the wrong time to reap the rewards of medical science. He lives a low-key, independent life. But then he is offered a chance to try a brand-new experimental “cure” for his condition. With this treatment Lou would think and act and be just like everyone else. But if he was suddenly free of autism, would he still be himself? Would he still love the same classical music—with its complications and resolutions? Would he still see the same colors and patterns in the world—shades and hues that others cannot see? Most important, would he still love Marjory, a woman who may never be able to reciprocate his feelings? Now Lou must decide if he should submit to a surgery that might completely change the way he views the world . . . and the very essence of who he is.

Then we die. And then . . . we get another try? Ten thousand tries, to be exact. Ten thousand lives to “get it right.” Answer all the Big Questions. Achieve Wisdom. And Become One with Everything. Milo has had 9,995 chances so far and has just five more lives to earn a place in the cosmic soul. If he doesn’t make the cut, oblivion awaits. But all Milo really wants is to fall forever into the arms of Death. Or Suzie, as he calls her. More than just Milo’s lover throughout his countless layovers in the Afterlife, Suzie is literally his reason for living—as he dives into one new existence after another, praying for the day he’ll never have to leave her side again. But Reincarnation Blues is more than a great love story: Every journey from cradle to grave offers Milo more pieces of the great cosmic puzzle—if only he can piece them together in time to finally understand what it means to be part of something bigger than infinity. As darkly enchanting as the works of Neil Gaiman and as wisely hilarious as Kurt Vonnegut’s, Michael Poore’s Reincarnation Blues is the story of everything that makes life profound, beautiful, absurd, and heartbreaking.

With her tricorne hat, flintlock rifle, and steampunked Model-A Ford, she was a living anachronism, and an irresistible mystery—and she was gone as soon as she arrived, in a cloud of gunfire and a squeal of tires. So when Eli sees her again, he’s determined that this time, he’s going to get some answers.

In Peak Performance, Brad Stulberg, a former McKinsey and Company consultant and writer who covers health and the science of human performance, and Steve Magness, a performance scientist and coach of Olympic athletes, team up to demystify these practices and demonstrate how you can achieve your best. The first book of its kind, Peak Performance combines the inspiring stories of top performers across a range of capabilities — from athletic, to intellectual, to artistic — with the latest scientific insights into the cognitive and neurochemical factors that drive performance in all domains.

In the Capitol, Grand Inquisitor Omand Vokkan hatches a plot to kill every member of the untouchable caste in all of Lok, down to the last man, woman, and child. As a member of the Order of Inquisition, Vokkan has no official say in the creation of Law, but he has powerful allies willing to do his bidding. Through them, he has convinced the Judges that the genocide will be swift, complete, and without complication. Nothing is farther from the truth. Lord Protector Devedas has sworn to uphold the Law. Once, he and the traitor Ashok Vadal had been like brothers. Now, he hunts Vadal and the Sons of the Black Sword, heretics and rebels who seek to live outside the rule of the Law. All Devedas must do is find and kill his best friend and order will be restored to Lok. The rebels seek the secret kingdom spoken of by the Prophet Thera, a paradise where water is pure and food plentiful, where there are no castes, where the people rule themselves, and are not slaves to the Capitol. Ashok Vadal is not sure he believes in such a Paradise, but he—along with his allies—do seek refuge in the rebellion’s hideout in Akershan. But Vadal, a former High Protector who has turned his back on the corrupt Law, will not merely wait meekly, hoping that fleeing to Akershan will spare the rebellion from the clutches of the Great Extermination. No, if it’s a war the Capitol wants, Vadal, who has faced down gods and demons, will be all too willing to give it to them.

Matters of privacy and government intrusion, post-Tinder romance, nihilistic terrorism, artificial consciousness, synthetic biology, and much more are tackled with authority and brash playfulness by New York Times bestselling author Rob Reid. Meet Phluttr—a diabolically addictive new social network and a villainess, heroine, enemy, and/or bestie to millions. Phluttr has ingested every fact and message ever sent to, from, and about her innumerable users. Her capabilities astound her makers—and they don’t even know the tenth of it. But what’s the purpose of this stunning creation? Is it a front for something even darker and more powerful than the NSA? A bid to create a trillion-dollar market by becoming “The UberX of Sex”? Or a reckless experiment that could spawn the digital equivalent of a middle-school mean girl with enough charisma, dirt, and cunning to bend the entire planet to her will? Phluttr has it in her to become the greatest gossip, flirt, or matchmaker in history. Or she could cure cancer, bring back Seinfeld, then start a nuclear war. Whatever she does, it’s not up to us. But a motley band of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, and engineers might be able to influence her. After On achieves the literary singularity—fusing speculative satire and astonishing reality into a sharp-witted, ferociously believable, IMAX-wide view of our digital age.

Best Science Books of 2018 - Bookbub. Every creation begins as a thought, from a symphony to a marriage to an ice cream cone to a rocket launch. When we have an intention, a complex chain of events begins in our brains. Thoughts travel as electrical impulses along neural pathways. When neurons fire together they wire together, creating electromagnetic fields. These fields are invisible energy, yet they influence the molecules of matter around us the way a magnet organizes iron filings. In Mind to Matter, award-winning researcher Dawson Church explains the science showing how our minds create matter. Different intentions produce different fields and different material creations. The thoughts and energy fields we cultivate in our minds condition the atoms and molecules around us. We can now trace the science behind each link in chain from thought to thing, showing the surprising ways in which our intentions create the material world. The science in the book is illustrated by many authentic case histories of people who harnessed the extraordinary power of the mind to create. They include: Adeline, whose Stage 4 cancer disappeared after she imagined \"healing stars\" Raymond Aaron and two of his clients, each of whom manifested $1 million in the same week Elon Musk, who bounced back from devastating tragedy to found Tesla and SpaceX Graham Phillips, who grew the emotional regulation part of his brain by 22.8% in two months Jennifer Graf, whose grandfather's long-dead radio came to life to play love songs the day of her wedding Harold, whose 80% hearing loss reversed in an hour Joe Marana, whose deceased sister comforted him from beyond the grave Rick Geggie, whose clogged arteries cleared up the night before cardiac surgery Matthias Rust, a teen whose \"airplane flight for peace\" changed the fate of superpowers Wanda Burch, whose dream about cancer told the surgeon exactly where to look for it An MIT freshman student who can precipitate sodium crystals with his mind John, who found himself floating out of his body and returned to find his AIDS healed Dean, whose cortisol levels dropped by 48% in a single hour In Mind to Matter, Dawson Church shows that these outcomes aren't a lucky accident only a few people experience. Neuroscientists have measured a specific brain wave formula that is linked to manifestation. This \"flow state\" can be learned and applied by anyone. New discoveries in epigenetics, neuroscience, electromagnetism, psychology, vibration, and quantum physics connect each step in the process by which mind creates matter. They show that the whole universe is self-organizing, and when our minds are in a state of flow, they coordinate with nature's emergent intelligence to produce synchronous outcomes. The book contained over 150 photos and illustrations that explain the process, while an \"Extended Play\" section at the end of each chapter provides additional resources. As Mind to Matter drops each piece of the scientific puzzle into place, it leaves us with a profound understanding of the enormous creative potential of our minds. It also gives us a road map to cultivating these remarkable brain states in our daily lives.","author":"Dawson Church","authors":["Dawson Church"],"narratedBy":"Dawson Church","publishedYear":2018,"releaseDate":"2019-08-06","publisher":"Hay House, Inc","pageCount":361,"bookLength":"10:48:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xWH6DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","categories":["Health & Wellness - Psychology & Mental Health - Psychology","Body, Mind & Spirit"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Health Wellness"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Unfu*k Yourself","description":"Have you ever felt like a hamster on a wheel, furiously churning your way through life but somehow going nowhere?

Sethi covers how to save time by not wasting it managing money; the guns and cars myth of credit cards; how to negotiate like an Indian--the conversation begins with \"no\"; why \"Budgeting Doesn't Have to Suck!\"; how to get things rolling--for real--with only $20; what most people don't understand about taxes; how to get a CEO to take you out to lunch; how to avoid the Super Mario Brothers trap by making your savings work harder than you do; the difference between cheap and frugal; the hidden relationship between money and food.

Integrated with his website, where readers can use interactive charts, follow up on the latest information, and join the community, it is a hip blueprint to building wealth and financial security.

In Mitch Albom’s beloved novel, The Five People You Meet in Heaven, the world fell in love with Eddie, a grizzled war veteran-turned-amusement park mechanic who died saving the life of a young girl named Annie. Eddie’s journey to heaven taught him that every life matters. Now, in this magical sequel, Albom reveals Annie’s story. The accident that killed Eddie left an indelible mark on Annie. It took her left hand, which needed to be surgically reattached. Injured, scarred, and unable to remember why, Annie’s life is forever changed by a guilt-ravaged mother who whisks her away from the world she knew. Bullied by her peers and haunted by something she cannot recall, Annie struggles to find acceptance as she grows. When, as a young woman, she reconnects with Paulo, her childhood love, she believes she has finally found happiness. As the novel opens, Annie is marrying Paulo. But when her wedding night day ends in an unimaginable accident, Annie finds herself on her own heavenly journey—and an inevitable reunion with Eddie, one of the five people who will show her how her life mattered in ways she could not have fathomed.

In Origin Story, Christian takes readers on a wild ride through the entire 13.8 billion years we've come to know as \"history.\" By focusing on defining events (thresholds), major trends, and profound questions about our origins, Christian exposes the hidden threads that tie everything together -- from the creation of the planet to the advent of agriculture, nuclear war, and beyond. With stunning insights into the origin of the universe, the beginning of life, the emergence of humans, and what the future might bring, Origin Story boldly reframes our place in the cosmos.","author":"David Christian","authors":["David Christian"],"narratedBy":"Jamie Jackson","publishedYear":2018,"releaseDate":"2018-05-22","publisher":"Little, Brown","pageCount":368,"bookLength":"12:23:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=c-5WswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","categories":["Science & Engineering - Science - Astronomy & Space Science - Astronomy","History"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Education"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Have a Nice Day","description":"Hilarious and heartfelt observations on aging from one of America's favorite comedians as he turns 65, and a look back at a remarkable career in this New York Times bestseller. Billy Crystal is turning 65, and he's not happy about it. With his trademark wit and heart, he outlines the absurdities and challenges that come with growing old, from insomnia to memory loss to leaving dinners with half your meal on your shirt. In humorous chapters like \"Buying the Plot\" and \"Nodding Off,\" Crystal not only catalogues his physical gripes, but offers a road map to his 77 million fellow baby boomers who are arriving at this milestone age with him. He also looks back at the most powerful and memorable moments of his long and storied life, from entertaining his relatives as a kid in Long Beach, Long Island, his years doing stand-up in the Village, up through his legendary stint at Saturday Night Live, When Harry Met Sally, and his long run as host of the Academy Awards. Readers get a front-row seat to his one-day career with the New York Yankees (he was the first player to ever \"test positive for Maalox\"), his love affair with Sophia Loren, and his enduring friendships with several of his idols, including Mickey Mantle and Muhammad Ali. He lends a light touch to more serious topics like religion (\"the aging friends I know have turned to the Holy Trinity: Advil, bourbon, and Prozac\"), grandparenting, and, of course, dentistry. As wise and poignant as they are funny, Crystal's reflections are an unforgettable look at an extraordinary life well lived.","author":"Billy Crystal","authors":["Billy Crystal"],"narratedBy":"full cast ","publishedYear":2018,"releaseDate":"2013-09-10","publisher":"Henry Holt and Company","pageCount":288,"bookLength":"1:46:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kxwm9u8hXAYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","categories":["Literature & Fiction - Drama & Plays","Biography & Autobiography"],"pathPrimaryCat":"Fiction","pathSecondaryCat":"General Fiction"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Atomic Habits","author":"James Clear","authors":["James Clear"],"narratedBy":"James Clear","publishedYear":2018,"releaseDate":"2019-10","pageCount":320,"bookLength":"5:35:00","imageURL":"","categories":["Relationships, Parenting & Personal Development - Personal Development - Personal Success"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Productivity"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Twain’s Feast","author":"Audible Originals","narratedBy":"Nick Offerman","publishedYear":2018,"bookLength":"4:27:00","categories":["History - Americas"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"General Fiction"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Feel Better Fast and Make It Last","description":"If you want to feel happier, more optimistic, more joyful, and resilient, Dr. Amen’s groundbreaking new book is for you. We’ve all felt anxious, sad, traumatized, grief-stricken, stressed, angry, or hopeless at some point in life. It’s perfectly normal to go through emotional crises or have periods when you feel panicked or out of sorts. It is how you respond to these challenges that will make all the difference in how you feel—not just immediately, but also in the long run. Unfortunately, many people turn to self-medicating behaviors, such as overeating, drugs, alcohol, risky sexual behavior, anger, or wasting time on mindless TV, video games, Internet surfing, or shopping. And even though these behaviors may give temporary relief from feeling bad, they usually only prolong and exacerbate the problems—or cause other, more serious ones. Is it possible to feel better—and make it last? Renowned physician, psychiatrist, brain-imaging researcher, and founder of Amen Clinics Dr. Daniel Amen understands how critical it is for you to know what will help you feel better fast, now and later. In Feel Better Fast and Make It Last, you’ll discover new, powerful brain-based strategies to quickly gain control over anxiety, worry, sadness, stress and anger, strengthening your resilience and giving you joy and purpose for a lifetime.","author":"Daniel G.

When Dave Asprey started his Bulletproof Radio podcast more than five years ago, he sought out thought leaders and influencers in an array of disciplines, from biochemists to business titans to mediation masters. These folks were some of the top performing humans in the world, people who had changed their areas of study or even pioneered entirely new fields. Dave wanted to know: What did they have in common? What mattered most to them? What makes them so successful at what they do--and what makes them happiest? And so, at the end of each interview, Dave began asking the same question: \"What are your top three recommendations for people who want to kick more ass?\"Combing through the recordings, looking for patterns and common threads, he found that the wisdom gleaned from these highly successful people can be distilled into three main categories: body, mind, and spirit. Game Changers is the culmination of Dave's years-long statistical analysis of these conversations, offering thirty-six science-backed, high performance \"laws\" that are a virtual playbook for how to become not only more successful, but also happier and healthier.Each chapter of Game Changers is structured around one of these laws. Dave combines anecdotes from game changers like Daniel Amen, David Perlmutter, Arianna Huffington, Dan Harris, and Tim Ferris with his own research and practical advice that readers can put into action immediately. From practising gratitude and mindfulness to prioritising social connections and sex, taming fear and anxiety to optimising nutrition and movement, Dave brings together the wisdom of today's game-changers to help everyone optimise their lives.","author":"Dave Asprey","authors":["Dave Asprey"],"narratedBy":"Dave Asprey ","publishedYear":2018,"releaseDate":"2018-12-17","publisher":"HarperThorsons","pageCount":256,"bookLength":"11:12:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2_4KugEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","categories":["Relationships, Parenting & Personal Development - Personal Development - Personal Success"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Productivity"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Alien: Out of the Shadows","description":"The massively acclaimed Alien franchise is one of the most successful of all time, beginning with the first film in 1979.

We know of psychopaths from chilling headlines and stories in the news and movies—from Ted Bundy and John Wayne Gacy, to Hannibal Lecter and Dexter Morgan. As Dr. Kent Kiehl shows, psychopaths can be identified by a checklist of symptoms that includes pathological lying; lack of empathy, guilt, and remorse; grandiose sense of self-worth; manipulation; and failure to accept one’s actions. But why do psychopaths behave the way they do? Is it the result of their environment— how they were raised—or is there a genetic compo­nent to their lack of conscience? This is the question Kiehl, a protégé of famed psychopath researcher Dr. Robert Hare, was deter­mined to answer as he began his career twenty years ago. To aid in his quest to unravel the psy­chopathic mind, Kiehl created the first mobile functional MRI scanner to study psychopaths in prison populations. The brains of more than five hundred psychopaths and three thousand other offenders have been scanned by Kiehl’s labora­tory—the world’s largest forensic neuroscience repository of its kind. Over the course of The Psy­chopath Whisperer, we follow the scientific bread crumbs that Kiehl uncovered to show that the key brain structures that correspond with emotional engagement and reactions are diminished in psy­chopaths, offering new clues to how to predict and treat the disorder. In The Psychopath Whisperer, Kiehl describes in fascinating detail his years working with psy­chopaths and studying their thought processes— from the remorseless serial killers he meets with behind bars to children whose behavior and per­sonality traits exhibit the early warning signs of psychopathy. Less than 1 percent of the general population meets the criteria for psychopathy. But psycho­paths account for a vastly outsized proportion of violent crimes. And as Kiehl shows, many who aren’t psychopaths exhibit some of the behaviors and traits associated with the condition. What do you do if you discover your roommate, or boss, or the person you are dating has traits that define a psy­chopath? And what does having a diminished limbic region of the brain mean for how the legal system approaches crimes committed by psychopaths? A compelling narrative of cutting-edge science, The Psychopath Whisperer will open your eyes on a fascinating but little understood world, with startling implications for society, the law, and our personal lives.","author":"Kent A.

Move over, Orange Is the New Black.”—Amy Dresner, author of My Fair Junkie When word got out that Tiffany Jenkins was withdrawing from opiates on the floor of a jail cell, people in her town were shocked. Not because of the twenty felonies she’d committed, or the nature of her crimes, or even that she’d been captain of the high school cheerleading squad just a few years earlier, but because her boyfriend was a Deputy Sherriff, and his friends—their friends—were the ones who’d arrested her. A raw and twisty page-turning memoir that reads like fiction, High Achiever spans Tiffany’s life as an active opioid addict, her 120 days in a Florida jail where every officer despised what she’d done to their brother in blue, and her eventual recovery. With heart-racing urgency and unflinching honesty, Jenkins takes you inside the grips of addiction and the desperate decisions it breeds. She is a born storyteller who lived an incredible story, from blackmail by an ex-boyfriend to a soul-shattering deal with a drug dealer, and her telling brims with suspense and unexpected wit. But the true surprise is her path to recovery.

The grandmother is Swedish, a retired domestic. The boy is Ethiopian and adopted, and he will grow up to become the world-renowned chef Marcus Samuelsson.

At Red Rooster, Samuelsson has fulfilled his dream of creating a truly diverse, multiracial dining room—a place where presidents rub elbows with jazz musicians, aspiring artists, and bus drivers. It is a place where an orphan from Ethiopia, raised in Sweden, living in America, can feel at home.

[Pollan] masterfully elevates a series of big questions about drugs, plants and humans that are likely to leave readers thinking in new ways.” —New York Times Book Review From #1 New York Times bestselling author Michael Pollan, a radical challenge to how we think about drugs, and an exploration into the powerful human attraction to psychoactive plants—and the equally powerful taboos. Of all the things humans rely on plants for—sustenance, beauty, medicine, fragrance, flavor, fiber—surely the most curious is our use of them to change consciousness: to stimulate or calm, fiddle with or completely alter, the qualities of our mental experience. Take coffee and tea: People around the world rely on caffeine to sharpen their minds. But we do not usually think of caffeine as a drug, or our daily use as an addiction, because it is legal and socially acceptable. So, then, what is a “drug”? And why, for example, is making tea from the leaves of a tea plant acceptable, but making tea from a seed head of an opium poppy a federal crime? In This Is Your Mind on Plants, Michael Pollan dives deep into three plant drugs—opium, caffeine, and mescaline—and throws the fundamental strangeness, and arbitrariness, of our thinking about them into sharp relief. Exploring and participating in the cultures that have grown up around these drugs while consuming (or, in the case of caffeine, trying not to consume) them, Pollan reckons with the powerful human attraction to psychoactive plants. Why do we go to such great lengths to seek these shifts in consciousness, and then why do we fence that universal desire with laws and customs and fraught feelings? In this unique blend of history, science, and memoir, as well as participatory journalism, Pollan examines and experiences these plants from several very different angles and contexts, and shines a fresh light on a subject that is all too often treated reductively—as a drug, whether licit or illicit. But that is one of the least interesting things you can say about these plants, Pollan shows, for when we take them into our bodies and let them change our minds, we are engaging with nature in one of the most profound ways we can. Based in part on an essay published almost twenty-five years ago, this groundbreaking and singular consideration of psychoactive plants, and our attraction to them through time, holds up a mirror to our fundamental human needs and aspirations, the operations of our minds, and our entanglement with the natural world.","author":"Michael Pollan","authors":["Michael Pollan"],"narratedBy":"Michael Pollan","publishedYear":2020,"releaseDate":"2022-07-19","publisher":"Penguin","pageCount":289,"bookLength":"2:02:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Yd9qEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","categories":["Politics & Social Sciences - Social Sciences","Body, Mind & Spirit"],"pathPrimaryCat":"","pathSecondaryCat":"Self Help"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"The Course in Miracles Experiment","description":"ACIM, the Fun Version!

But are we really justified in believing this? For centuries philosophers have argued about whether free will and moral responsibility are compatible with determinism or natural causation, and they seem no closer to agreeing about it now than at any time in the past. Many contemporary philosophers have come to the conclusion that the intractability of the old argument about free will and determinism is caused by deep rooted illusions and inconsistencies in our unreflective attitudes about moral responsibility and freedom to act. Kevin Magill challenges this view and argues that the philosophical stalemate about free will has arisen through lack of attention to the content of the experiences that shape our understanding of free will and agency and through a mistaken belief that the concept of moral responsibility requires a moral and metaphysical justification. The book sets out an original account of the various ways we experience choosing, deciding and acting, which reconciles the apparently opposing intuitions that have fuelled the traditional dispute.","author":"Kevin Hart","authors":["Kevin Magill"],"narratedBy":"Kevin Hart","publishedYear":2020,"releaseDate":"2016-01-18","publisher":"DR KEVIN MAGILL","pageCount":218,"bookLength":"5:54:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7aJqCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","categories":["Relationships, Parenting & Personal Development - Personal Development - Personal Success","Philosophy"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Productivity"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Treasure Island","author":"Robert Louis Stevenson","authors":["Robert Louis Stevenson"],"narratedBy":"Philip Glenister ","publishedYear":2017,"releaseDate":"2013","bookLength":"6:23:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KmeaoAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","categories":["Literature & Fiction - Classics","Adventure stories"],"pathPrimaryCat":"Fiction","pathSecondaryCat":"General Fiction"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Beyond Strange Lands","description":"An exploration of the elaborate relationship between farmers, aerial sprayers, agriculturalists, crop pests, chemicals, and the environment. The controversies in the 1960s and 1970s that swirled around indiscriminate use of agricultural chemicals—their long-term ecological harm versus food production benefits—were sparked and clarified by biologist Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring (1962). This seminal publication challenged long-held assumptions concerning the industrial might of American agriculture while sounding an alarm for the damaging persistence of pesticides, especially chlorinated hydrocarbons such as DDT, in the larger environment. In Chemical Lands: Pesticides, Aerial Spraying, and Health in North America’s Grasslands since 1945 David D. Vail shows, however, that a distinctly regional view of agricultural health evolved. His analysis reveals a particularly strong ethic in the North American grasslands where practitioners sought to understand and deploy insecticides and herbicides by designing local scientific experiments, engineering more precise aircraft sprayers, developing more narrowly specific chemicals, and planting targeted test crops. Their efforts to link the science of toxicology with environmental health reveal how the practitioners of pesticides evaluated potential hazards in the agricultural landscape while recognizing the production benefits of controlled spraying. Chemical Lands adds to a growing list of books on toxins in the American landscape. This study provides a unique Grasslands perspective of the Ag pilots, weed scientists, and farmers who struggled to navigate novel technologies for spray planes and in the development of new herbicides/insecticides while striving to manage and mitigate threats to human health and the environment.","author":"David Peterson","authors":["David D.

Like millions of her millennial peers, Rachel Held Evans didn't want to go to church anymore. The hypocrisy, the politics, the gargantuan building budgets, the scandals--to her, it was beginning to feel like church culture was too far removed from Jesus. Yet, despite her cynicism and misgivings, something kept drawing Evans back to church. Evans found herself wanting to better understand the church and find her place within it, so she set out on a new adventure. Within the pages of Searching for Sunday, Evans catalogs her journey as she loves, leaves, and finds the church once again. Evans tells the story of her faith through the lens of seven sacraments of the Catholic church--baptism, confession, holy orders, communion, confirmation, the anointing of the sick, and marriage--to teach us the essential truths about what she's learned along the way, including: Faith isn't just meant to be believed, it's meant to be lived and shared in community Christianity isn't a kingdom for the worthy--it's a kingdom for the hungry, the broken, and the imperfect The countless and beautiful ways that God shows up in the ordinary parts of our daily lives Searching for Sunday will help you unpack the messiness of community, teaching us that by overcoming our cynicism, we can all find hope, grace, love, and, somewhere in between, church.","author":"Rachel Held Evans","authors":["Rachel Held Evans"],"narratedBy":"Rachel Held Evans","publishedYear":2015,"releaseDate":"2015-04-14","publisher":"Thomas Nelson","pageCount":288,"bookLength":"7:28:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1xuMBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","categories":["Religion & Spirituality - Christianity - Bibles & Bible Study - Bible Study","Religion"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Spirituality"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"The Cuckoo's Cry","author":"Caroline Overington","authors":["Caroline Overington"],"narratedBy":"Aimee Horne","publishedYear":2020,"releaseDate":"2021","bookLength":"4:43:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DNWJzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","categories":["Mystery, Thriller & Suspense - Thriller & Suspense - Domestic Thrillers"],"pathPrimaryCat":"Fiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Action Suspense"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"The You I've Never Known","description":"How do you live your life if your past is based on a lie?

Dad says home is wherever the two of them are, but Ariel is now seventeen and after years of new apartments, new schools, and new faces, all she wants is to put down some roots. Complicating things are Monica and Gabe, both of whom have stirred a different kind of desire.

Fumio Sasaki is not an enlightened minimalism expert or organizing guru like Marie Kondo—he’s just a regular guy who was stressed out and constantly comparing himself to others, until one day he decided to change his life by saying goodbye to everything he didn’t absolutely need. The effects were remarkable: Sasaki gained true freedom, new focus, and a real sense of gratitude for everything around him. In Goodbye, Things Sasaki modestly shares his personal minimalist experience, offering specific tips on the minimizing process and revealing how the new minimalist movement can not only transform your space but truly enrich your life. The benefits of a minimalist life can be realized by anyone, and Sasaki’s humble vision of true happiness will open your eyes to minimalism’s potential.","author":"Fumio Sasaki","authors":["Fumio Sasaki"],"narratedBy":"Keith Szarabajka","publishedYear":2017,"releaseDate":"2017-04-11","publisher":"National Geographic Books","bookLength":"4:32:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fF-NEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","categories":["Relationships, Parenting & Personal Development - Personal Development - Personal Success","House & Home"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Productivity"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"The Craving Mind","description":"A leading neuroscientist and pioneer in the study of mindfulness explains why addictions are so tenacious and how we can learn to conquer them We are all vulnerable to addiction. Whether it’s a compulsion to constantly check social media, binge eating, smoking, excessive drinking, or any other behaviors, we may find ourselves uncontrollably repeating. Why are bad habits so hard to overcome? Is there a key to conquering the cravings we know are unhealthy for us? This book provides groundbreaking answers to the most important questions about addiction. Dr. Judson Brewer, a psychiatrist and neuroscientist who has studied the science of addictions for twenty years, reveals how we can tap into the very processes that encourage addictive behaviors in order to step out of them. He describes the mechanisms of habit and addiction formation, then explains how the practice of mindfulness can interrupt these habits. Weaving together patient stories, his own experience with mindfulness practice, and current scientific findings from his own lab and others, Dr. Brewer offers a path for moving beyond our cravings, reducing stress, and ultimately living a fuller life.","author":"Judson Brewer","authors":["Judson Brewer"],"narratedBy":"P.

While teaching in Europe, he meets a prostitute who secures drugs for him at the dangerous price of helping out the Russian mafia; in China, he gets his Percocet and Xanax fix but terrifies a crowd of children and parents at his job in the process; and in Mexico, Smith thought a Tijuana jail cell would be the perfect place to kick his Fentanyl habit, but soon realizes that the power of addiction is stronger than his desire to escape it.

You'll never find a wiser advisor with a bigger heart.\" -- Malachi Rempen: Filmmaker, cartoonist, author and self-described ruffian This book grew out of a series of letters to my daughter concerning various things-mostly about money and investing-she was not yet quite ready to hear. Since money is the single most powerful tool we have for navigating this complex world we've created, understanding it is critical. \"But Dad,\" she once said, \"I know money is important. I just don't want to spend my life thinking about it.\" This was eye-opening. I love this stuff. But most people have better things to do with their precious time. Bridges to build, diseases to cure, treaties to negotiate, mountains to climb, technologies to create, children to teach, businesses to run. Unfortunately, benign neglect of things financial leaves you open to the charlatans of the financial world. The people who make investing endlessly complex, because if it can be made complex it becomes more profitable for them, more expensive for us, and we are forced into their waiting arms. Here's an important truth: Complex investments exist only to profit those who create and sell them. Not only are they more costly to the investor, they are less effective. The simple approach I created for her and present now to you, is not only easy to understand and implement, it is more powerful than any other. Together we'll explore: Debt: Why you must avoid it and what to do if you have it. The importance of having F-you Money. How to think about money, and the unique way understanding this is key to building your wealth. Where traditional investing advice goes wrong and what actually works. What the stock market really is and how it really works. Why the stock market always goes up and why most people still lose money investing in it. How to invest in a raging bull, or bear, market. Specific investments to implement these strategies. The Wealth Building and Wealth Preservation phases of your investing life and why they are not always tied to your age. How your asset allocation is tied to those phases and how to choose it. How to simplify the sometimes confusing world of 401(k), 403(b), TSP, IRA and Roth accounts. TRFs (Target Retirement Funds), HSAs (Health Savings Accounts) and RMDs (Required Minimum Distributions). What investment firm to use and why the one I recommend is so far superior to the competition. Why you should be very cautious when engaging an investment advisor and whether you need to at all. Why and how you can be conned, and how to avoid becoming prey. Why I don't recommend dollar cost averaging. What financial independence looks like and how to have your money support you. What the 4% rule is and how to use it to safely spend your wealth. The truth behind Social Security. A Case Study on how this all can be implemented in real life.

Only one man was allowed to record extensive interviews with the shooter. This is what he found. Now with an update by the author. On July 20, 2012 in Aurora, Colorado, a man in dark body armor and a gas mask entered a midnight premiere of The Dark Knight Rises with a tactical shotgun, a high-capacity assault rifle, and a sidearm. He threw a canister of tear gas into the crowd and began firing. Soon twelve were dead and fifty-eight were wounded; young children and pregnant women were among them. The man was found calmly waiting at his car. He was detained without resistance. Unlike the Columbine, Newtown, San Bernadino, Orlando, Las Vegas, and Jacksonville shootings, and James Holmes is unique among mass shooters in his willingness to be taken into custody alive; the massacre was a precursor to those in New Zealand and Parkland. In the court case that followed, only Dr. William H. Reid, a distinguished forensic psychiatrist, would be allowed to record interviews with the defendant. Reid would read Holmes’ diary, investigate his phone calls and text messages, interview his family and acquaintances, speak to his victims, and review tens of thousands of pages of evidence and court testimony in an attempt to understand how a happy, seemingly normal child could become a killer. Now in paperback and updated by Dr. Reid, A Dark Night in Aurora uses the twenty-three hours of unredacted interview transcripts never seen by the public and Reid’s research to bring the reader inside the mind of a mass murderer. The result is chilling, gripping study of abnormal psychology and how a lovely boy named Jimmy became a killer.","author":"William H. Reid MD MPH","authors":["Dr. William H.

SOON TO BE A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE “[Picoult] offers a thought-provoking examination of racism in America today, both overt and subtle. Her many readers will find much to discuss in the pages of this topical, moving book.”—Booklist (starred review) Ruth Jefferson is a labor and delivery nurse at a Connecticut hospital with more than twenty years’ experience. During her shift, Ruth begins a routine checkup on a newborn, only to be told a few minutes later that she’s been reassigned to another patient. The parents are white supremacists and don’t want Ruth, who is African American, to touch their child. The hospital complies with their request, but the next day, the baby goes into cardiac distress while Ruth is alone in the nursery. Does she obey orders or does she intervene? Ruth hesitates before performing CPR and, as a result, is charged with a serious crime. Kennedy McQuarrie, a white public defender, takes her case but gives unexpected advice: Kennedy insists that mentioning race in the courtroom is not a winning strategy. Conflicted by Kennedy’s counsel, Ruth tries to keep life as normal as possible for her family—especially her teenage son—as the case becomes a media sensation. As the trial moves forward, Ruth and Kennedy must gain each other’s trust, and come to see that what they’ve been taught their whole lives about others—and themselves—might be wrong. With incredible empathy, intelligence, and candor, Jodi Picoult tackles race, privilege, prejudice, justice, and compassion—and doesn’t offer easy answers. Small Great Things is a remarkable achievement from a writer at the top of her game. Praise for Small Great Things “Small Great Things is the most important novel Jodi Picoult has ever written. . . . It will challenge her readers . . . [and] expand our cultural conversation about race and prejudice.”—The Washington Post “A novel that puts its finger on the very pulse of the nation that we live in today . . . a fantastic read from beginning to end, as can always be expected from Picoult, this novel maintains a steady, page-turning pace that makes it hard for readers to put down.”—San Francisco Book Review","author":"Jodi Picoult","authors":["Jodi Picoult"],"narratedBy":"Ari Fliakos ","publishedYear":2016,"releaseDate":"2016-10-11","publisher":"Ballantine Books","pageCount":528,"bookLength":"16:14:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eT5mCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","categories":["Literature & Fiction - Genre Fiction - Literary Fiction","Fiction"],"pathPrimaryCat":"Fiction","pathSecondaryCat":"General Fiction"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Unf*ck Your Adulting","description":"Do you freak out at small things?

Today millions of people have taken up a formal mindfulness meditation practice as part of their everyday lives. But how do you actually go about meditating?

Falling Awake directly answers these urgent and timely questions. Originally published in 2005 as part of a larger book titled Coming to Our Senses, it has been updated with a new foreword by the author and is even more relevant today.

Soon after he opened his vineyard for business many years ago, the Wealthy Gardener noticed a puzzling fact. Everyone wanted money, but only a few people managed to accumulate it. The reason, he realized, is that most people focus on short term gains instead of achieving lasting wealth. As he grew old and aware of his dwindling time on this Earth, the Wealthy Gardener began to share his hard-earned wisdom with the financially troubled in his community, patiently mentoring those who asked for his practical advice on the ways of prosperity. The parable of the Wealthy Gardener is far more than an admonishment to earn more or spend less; it is about timeless principles. As his lessons reveal, financial freedom is a means to power and control over our lives. Without money, we are subject to the demands and whims of others. With money, we are sheltered from the storm, and we can extend that shelter to our loved ones. Poised to become an intimate financial classic, The Wealthy Gardener will inspire readers to find their own noble purpose and relieve their money worries once and for all. No matter your income level, skillset, or unique economic disadvantages, the lessons in this book will show you the path forward. All you need is the will to work, the desire to succeed, and the motivation to learn.","author":"John Soforic","authors":["John Soforic"],"narratedBy":"Dennis Kleinman","publishedYear":2020,"releaseDate":"2020-02-25","publisher":"Penguin","pageCount":434,"bookLength":"12:56:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Q9LMDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","categories":["Relationships, Parenting & Personal Development - Personal Development - Personal Success","Business & Economics"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Productivity"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"The Tibetan Yoga of Breath","description":"Heal the body, quiet the mind, and find emotional balance with simple practices from Yantra Yoga Modern science and classic spiritual traditions agree: regulating the breath leads to radiance and wellness of body, mind, and spirit.

Many of us recognize that our brains struggle to multitask. Despite this, we feel compelled to do so anyway while we fill each moment of our lives to the brim with mindless distraction. Hyperfocus provides profound insights into how you can best take charge of your attention to achieve a greater sense of purpose and productivity throughout the day. The most recent neuroscientific research reveals that our brain has two powerful modes that can be unlocked when we use our attention effectively: a focused mode (hyperfocus), which is the foundation for being highly productive, and a creative mode (scatterfocus), which enables us to connect ideas in novel ways. Hyperfocus helps you access each of the two mental modes so you can concentrate more deeply, think more clearly, and work and live more deliberately every day. Chris Bailey examines such topics such as: • identifying and dealing with the four key types of distraction and interruption; • establishing a clear physical and mental environment in which to work; • controlling motivation and working fewer hours to become more productive; • taking time-outs with intention; • multitasking strategically; and • learning when to pay attention and when to let your mind wander wherever it wants to. By transforming how you think about your attention, Hyperfocus reveals that the more effectively you learn to take charge of it, the better you'll be able to manage every aspect of your life.","author":"Chris Bailey","authors":["Chris Bailey"],"narratedBy":"Chris Bailey","publishedYear":2021,"releaseDate":"2018-08-28","publisher":"Penguin","pageCount":256,"bookLength":"3:18:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Klw_DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","categories":["Health & Wellness - Physical Illness & Disease","Self-Help"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Health Wellness"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"The Final Empire","description":"From #1 New York Times bestselling author Brandon Sanderson, the Mistborn series is a heist story of political intrigue and magical, martial-arts action. For a thousand years the ash fell and no flowers bloomed. For a thousand years the Skaa slaved in misery and lived in fear. For a thousand years the Lord Ruler, the \"Sliver of Infinity,\" reigned with absolute power and ultimate terror, divinely invincible. Then, when hope was so long lost that not even its memory remained, a terribly scarred, heart-broken half-Skaa rediscovered it in the depths of the Lord Ruler's most hellish prison. Kelsier \"snapped\" and found in himself the powers of a Mistborn. A brilliant thief and natural leader, he turned his talents to the ultimate caper, with the Lord Ruler himself as the mark. Kelsier recruited the underworld's elite, the smartest and most trustworthy allomancers, each of whom shares one of his many powers, and all of whom relish a high-stakes challenge. Only then does he reveal his ultimate dream, not just the greatest heist in history, but the downfall of the divine despot. But even with the best criminal crew ever assembled, Kel's plan looks more like the ultimate long shot, until luck brings a ragged girl named Vin into his life. Like him, she's a half-Skaa orphan, but she's lived a much harsher life. Vin has learned to expect betrayal from everyone she meets, and gotten it. She will have to learn to trust, if Kel is to help her master powers of which she never dreamed. This saga dares to ask a simple question: What if the hero of prophecy fails?

The ultimate UFC underdog, Bisping fought his way to Number One contender three times, only to be knocked back each time. But he refused to give in, clawing his way to his first World Title shot at the age of thirty-seven—and becoming the first ever British UFC world champion. Bisping offers fresh insights about his fighting career, never-before-told stories about his film and TV career, and a harrowing account of his fighting off attempted kidnappers while filming in South Africa. Loaded with the humor and brutal honesty that first won him a following on the television show Ultimate Fighter 3, Bisping recounts his record setting thirteen-year fight career battling the likes of Anderson Silva, Georges St-Pierre, and Dan Henderson.","author":"Michael Bisping","authors":["Michael Bisping","Anthony Evans"],"narratedBy":"Jonathan Cowley","publishedYear":2020,"releaseDate":"2020-01-21","publisher":"Diversion Books","pageCount":423,"bookLength":"13:15:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OaC8DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","categories":["Sports & Outdoors - Combat Sports & Self-Defense","Biography & Autobiography"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Education"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"The Gone World","description":"Inception meets True Detective in this science fiction thriller of spellbinding tension and staggering scope that follows a special agent into a savage murder case with grave implications for the fate of mankind.... “I promise you have never read a story like this.”—Blake Crouch, New York Times bestselling author of Dark Matter Shannon Moss is part of a clandestine division within the Naval Criminal Investigative Service.

With more than forty simple, effective techniques, you'll learn how to overcome every conceivable kind of anxiety without medication. Are you plagued by fears, phobias, or panic attacks? Do you toss and turn at night with a knot in your stomach, worrying about your job, your family, work, your health, or relationships? Do you suffer from crippling shyness, obsessive doubts, or feelings of insecurity? What you may not realize is that these fears are almost never based on reality. When you’re anxious, you’re actually fooling yourself, telling yourself things that simply aren’t true. See if you can recognize yourself in any of these distortions: All-or-Nothing Thinking: “My mind will go blank when I give my presentation at work, and everyone will think I’m an idiot.” Fortune Telling: “I just know I’ll freeze up and blow it when I take my test.” Mind Reading: “Everyone at this party can see how nervous I am.” Magnification: “Flying is so dangerous. I think this plane is going to crash!” Should Statements: “I shouldn’t be so anxious and insecure. Other people don’t feel this way.” Emotional Reasoning: “I feel like I’m on the verge of cracking up!” Self-Blame: “What’s wrong with me? I’m such a loser!” Mental Filter: “Why can’t I get anything done? My life seems like one long procrastination.” Now imagine what it would feel like to live a life that’s free of worries and self-doubt; to go to sleep at night feeling peaceful and relaxed; to overcome your shyness and have fun with other people; to give dynamic presentations without worrying yourself sick ahead of time; to enjoy greater creativity, productivity and self-confidence. With these forty techniques, you'll be able to put the lie to the distorted thoughts that plague you and your fears will immediately disappear. Dr. Burns also shares the latest research on the drugs commonly prescribed for anxiety and depression and explains why they may sometimes do more harm than good. This is not pop psychology but proven, fast-acting techniques that have been shown to be more effective than medications. When Panic Attacks is an indispensable handbook for anyone who’s worried sick and sick of worrying.","author":"David D. Burns MD","authors":["David D.

Ten years later, and against all odds, this upstart autonomous decentralized software offers an unstoppable and globally accessible hard money alternative to modern central banks. The Bitcoin Standard analyzes the historical context to the rise of Bitcoin, the economic properties that have allowed it to grow quickly, and its likely economic, political, and social implications. While Bitcoin is an invention of the digital age, the problem it purports to solve is as old as human society itself: transferring value across time and space. Author Saifedean Ammous takes the reader on an engaging journey through the history of technologies performing the functions of money, from primitive systems of trading limestones and seashells, to metals, coins, the gold standard, and modern government debt. Exploring what gave these technologies their monetary role, and how most lost it, provides the reader with a good idea of what makes for sound money, and sets the stage for an economic discussion of its consequences for individual and societal future-orientation, capital accumulation, trade, peace, culture, and art. Compellingly, Ammous shows that it is no coincidence that the loftiest achievements of humanity have come in societies enjoying the benefits of sound monetary regimes, nor is it coincidental that monetary collapse has usually accompanied civilizational collapse. With this background in place, the book moves on to explain the operation of Bitcoin in a functional and intuitive way. Bitcoin is a decentralized, distributed piece of software that converts electricity and processing power into indisputably accurate records, thus allowing its users to utilize the Internet to perform the traditional functions of money without having to rely on, or trust, any authorities or infrastructure in the physical world. Bitcoin is thus best understood as the first successfully implemented form of digital cash and digital hard money. With an automated and perfectly predictable monetary policy, and the ability to perform final settlement of large sums across the world in a matter of minutes, Bitcoin’s real competitive edge might just be as a store of value and network for the final settlement of large payments―a digital form of gold with a built-in settlement infrastructure. Ammous’ firm grasp of the technological possibilities as well as the historical realities of monetary evolution provides for a fascinating exploration of the ramifications of voluntary free market money. As it challenges the most sacred of government monopolies, Bitcoin shifts the pendulum of sovereignty away from governments in favor of individuals, offering us the tantalizing possibility of a world where money is fully extricated from politics and unrestrained by borders. The final chapter of the book explores some of the most common questions surrounding Bitcoin: Is Bitcoin mining a waste of energy? Is Bitcoin for criminals? Who controls Bitcoin, and can they change it if they please? How can Bitcoin be killed? And what to make of all the thousands of Bitcoin knockoffs, and the many supposed applications of Bitcoin’s ‘block chain technology’? The Bitcoin Standard is the essential resource for a clear understanding of the rise of the Internet’s decentralized, apolitical, free-market alternative to national central banks.","author":"Saifedean Ammous","authors":["Saifedean Ammous"],"narratedBy":"James Fouhey","publishedYear":2018,"releaseDate":"2018-03-23","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons","pageCount":304,"bookLength":"11:16:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Sw5TDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","categories":["Money & Finance - Personal Finance","Business & Economics"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Business Wealth"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"The Every","description":"From the award-winning, bestselling author of The Circle comes an exciting new follow-up.

Gravity affects every aspect of our physical being, but there’s a psychological force just as powerful—yet almost nobody has heard of it. It’s responsible for bringing groups of people together and pulling them apart, making certain goals attractive to some and not to others, and fueling cycles of anxiety and conflict. In Wanting, Luke Burgis draws on the work of French polymath René Girard to bring this hidden force to light and reveals how it shapes our lives and societies. According to Girard, humans don’t desire anything independently. Human desire is mimetic—we imitate what other people want. This affects the way we choose partners, friends, careers, clothes, and vacation destinations. Mimetic desire is responsible for the formation of our very identities. It explains the enduring relevancy of Shakespeare’s plays, why Peter Thiel decided to be the first investor in Facebook, and why our world is growing more divided as it becomes more connected. Wanting also shows that conflict does not arise because of our differences—it comes from our sameness. Because we learn to want what other people want, we often end up competing for the same things. Ignoring our large similarities, we cling to our perceived differences. Drawing on his experience as an entrepreneur, teacher, and student of classical philosophy and theology, Burgis shares tactics that help turn blind wanting into intentional wanting--not by trying to rid ourselves of desire, but by desiring differently. It’s possible to be more in control of the things we want, to achieve more independence from trends and bubbles, and to find more meaning in our work and lives. The future will be shaped by our desires. Wanting shows us how to desire a better one.","author":"Luke Burgis","authors":["Luke Burgis"],"narratedBy":"Luke Burgis ","publishedYear":2021,"releaseDate":"2021-06-01","publisher":"St. Martin's Press","pageCount":272,"bookLength":"8:54:58","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=u873DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","categories":["Health & Wellness - Psychology & Mental Health - Psychology","Business & Economics"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Health Wellness"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"Money Magic","author":"Laurence Kotlikoff","authors":["Laurence Kotlikoff"],"narratedBy":"Alex Kotlikoff","publishedYear":2022,"releaseDate":"2022-01-04","publisher":"Little, Brown","pageCount":320,"bookLength":"8:33:00","imageURL":"","categories":["Money & Finance - Personal Finance - Money Management & Budgeting"],"pathPrimaryCat":"NonFiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Business Wealth"},{"fullPath":"Audible","audioFileCount":1,"title":"The Paradox Hotel","description":"“Time travel, murder, corruption, restless baby dinosaurs, and a snarky robot named Ruby collide in this excellent, noir-inflected, humor-infused, science-fiction thriller.”—The Boston Globe An impossible crime.

Not that running security at the Paradox was ever really easy. Nothing’s simple at a hotel where the ultra-wealthy tourists arrive costumed for a dozen different time periods, all eagerly waiting to catch their “flights” to the past. Or where proximity to the timeport makes the clocks run backward on occasion—and, rumor has it, allows ghosts to stroll the halls. None of that compares to the corpse in room 526. The one that seems to be both there and not there. The one that somehow only January can see. On top of that, some very important new guests have just checked in. Because the U.S. government is about to privatize time-travel technology—and the world’s most powerful people are on hand to stake their claims. January is sure the timing isn’t a coincidence. Neither are those “accidents” that start stalking their bidders. There’s a reason January can glimpse what others can’t. A reason why she’s the only one who can catch a killer who’s operating invisibly and in plain sight, all at once. But her ability is also destroying her grip on reality—and as her past, present, and future collide, she finds herself confronting not just the hotel’s dark secrets but her own.

The science fiction of the 1960s promised us a future remade by technological innovation. We'd vacation in geodesic domes on Mars, have meaningful conversations with computers, and drop our children off at school in flying cars. Fast-forward 60 years, and we're still stuck in traffic in gas-guzzling sedans and boarding the same types of planes we flew in over half a century ago. What happened to the future we were promised? In Where Is My Flying Car?, J. Storrs Hall sets out to answer this deceptively simple question. What starts as an examination of the technical limitations of building flying cars evolves into an investigation of the scientific, technological, and social roots of the economic stagnation that started in the 1970s. From the failure to adopt nuclear energy and the suppression of cold fusion technology to the rise of a counterculture hostile to progress, Hall recounts how our collective ambitions for the future were derailed, with devastating consequences for global wealth creation and distribution. He then outlines a framework for a future powered by exponential progress--one in which we build as much in the world of atoms as we do in the world of bits, one rich in abundance and wonder. Drawing on years of original research and personal engineering experience, Where Is My Flying Car?, originally published in 2018, is an urgent, timely analysis of technological progress over the last 50 years and a bold vision for a better future.","author":"J.

In Victorian London, two children with mysterious powers are hunted by a figure of darkness--a man made of smoke. Sixteen-year-old Charlie Ovid, despite a brutal childhood in Mississippi, doesn't have a scar on him. His body heals itself, whether he wants it to or not. Marlowe, a foundling from a railway freight car, shines with a strange bluish light. He can melt or mend flesh.

There, the world of the dead and the world of the living threaten to collide. And as secrets within the Institute unfurl, Marlowe, Charlie and the rest of the Talents will discover the truth about their abilities, and the nature of what is stalking them: that the worst monsters sometimes come bearing the sweetest gifts.

They were followed on their quest by the shepherds: friends and family who gave up everything to protect them. Their secret destination: Ouray, a small town in Colorado that would become one of the last outposts of civilization. Because the sleepwalking epidemic was only the first in a chain of events that led to the end of the world—and the birth of a new one. The survivors, sleepwalkers and shepherds alike, have a dream of rebuilding human society. Among them are Benji, the scientist struggling through grief to lead the town; Marcy, the former police officer who wants only to look after the people she loves; and Shana, the teenage girl who became the first shepherd—and an unlikely hero whose courage will be needed again. Because the people of Ouray are not the only survivors, and the world they are building is fragile. The forces of cruelty and brutality are amassing under the leadership of self-proclaimed president Ed Creel. And in the very heart of Ouray, the most powerful survivor of all is plotting its own vision for the new world: Black Swan, the A.I. who imagined the apocalypse. Against these threats, Benji, Marcy, Shana, and the rest have only one hope: one another. Because the only way to survive the end of the world is together.","author":"Chuck Wendig","authors":["Chuck Wendig"],"narratedBy":"Dominic Hoffman ","publishedYear":2022,"releaseDate":"2022-11-15","publisher":"Del Rey","pageCount":1002,"bookLength":"34:27:00","imageURL":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6j9MEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","categories":["Mystery, Thriller & Suspense - Thriller & Suspense - Suspense","Fiction"],"pathPrimaryCat":"Fiction","pathSecondaryCat":"Action Suspense"}]
